In this notebook, 15-minute usage is defined as the proportion of consumption-related trips made within a 15-minute walk from a home. 15-minute access is defined as the number of essential amenities within the 15-minute walk from a home. Segregation is examined within this context to measure and assess the distribution of amenities within urban areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notebook-summary\">Notebook Summary</h2>\n<p>This project includes procedures for loading, analyzing, processing, then modeling mobility and segregation density within a defined 15-minute city. The process includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data loading and initial analysis.</li>\n<li>Define 15-minute city parameters for the given dataset.</li>\n<li>Identifying data file tags to define residents, streets, amenities, and places of work.</li>\n<li>Calculate routes between coordinates of residents and amenities through the shortest path profile.</li>\n<li>Project a grid of points to routes.</li>\n<li>Estimate populations in provided buildings.</li>\n<li>Interpret relations between routes and intersection density (segregation) with populations weighted.</li>\n<li>Calculate and model final data normalized with heatmap through Grasshopper and Rhino.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"usage\">Usage</h2>\n<p>The notebook is structured to be followed sequentially.

project aims to understand and reproduce data published by the National University of Singapore's (NUS) approach for microclimate prediction, the Geo-LSTM-Kriging Model. This model meshes three key layers to provide accurate microclimate predictions using local weatherstation data. The model takes together LULC data, historical data, and spatial distance information to learn from previous data and apply such learnings to present data. This combination is a novel combination of the strengths of LSTM's time series predictions and Kriging's spatial data dependencies.</p>\n<p>This team spent work cleaning up the open-source code from NUS to understand the model's inputs better. Having improved legibility, the adapatability of the model was clear to the team and allowed them to integrate campus-specific data. The team's work this semester was focused to replicate the NUS's model for Georgia Tech campus. The team used real weather data collected on GT campus coupled with Tech's Tree Viewer App to improve the accuracy of results for the campus. </p>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">Requirements</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Python</li>\n<li>Pandas</li>\n<li>Numpy</li>\n<li>OSMNX</li>\n<li>Scikit-Learn</li>\n<li>Pytorch</li>\n<li>Pykrige</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition this program requires that you provide a dataframe for the features you want to measure, as well as gridpoint data for the Kriging Regression. We\u2019ve provided test dataframes that you can find within the \u201cweather_station_5min\u201d and \u201cweather_station_60min\u201d folders. </p>\n<h2 id=\"repository-structure\">Repository Structure</h2>\n<p>This repo contains the aspects needed to replicate the Geo-Kriging LSTM Model. Inside the \u201cpython\u201d folder, you will find the necessary notebook files to execute it. The main ones to focus on are \u201cOrganized_Model_Eval.ipynb\u201d and \u201cosmnx 2.ipynb\u201d. The latter is used to gather the necessary gridpoint data for the kriging aspect and the former is utilized for execution of the models onto the data.</p>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<p>Each of the required libraries can be easily installed with pip. For OSMNX, a separate process is required. You can find it at this <a href=\"https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html\">link</a>. Once installed, run the \u201cosmnx 2.ipynb\u201d with the OX kernel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"methodology\">Methodology</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/1Methodology.png\" /></p>\n<p>For the methodology, the team used three wokflows: pre-processing, machine learning (ML) training, &amp; prediction and plotting. Pre-processing involves cleaning up the data and making it usable for the ML training workflow. For the spatial method that the team incorporated into the model, the OpenStreetMap Python library osmnx, and using the library, a map of Georgia Tech's campus was used as a basis. Overlayed on top of the map is system of equally spaced out points forming a grid. For each of the equidistant points, 12 distance vectors were obtained. Theses distances are from each point on the grid to the nearest centers of various variables; these various variables are buildings, libraries, parks, parking, footways, grass, fitness centers, woods, wetlands, trees on campus, and trees in Atlanta off Tech's campus. The tree data was not easily accessible through osmnx, so the team utilized Georgia Tech's Tree Viewer App for the tree location data and distances. In the Geo-LSTM-Kriging model that our team followed, Kriging is a statistical method for spacial interpolation, predicting unknown values at locations that don\u2019t have measured values by using spatial correlations. These spatial correlations, the 12 distance vectors for each x,y point, are based off of relationships between variables. Dr. Brian Stone's weather data obtained from the several weather stations he set up a year ago on Tech's campus was used as an input for pre-processing as well, and it mainly provided information on temperatures, dew point, and relative humidity. This is the data that our group tried to find out and this data will be used as a means for comparison and training the machine learning model. The weather data from Dr. Stone's weather stations were quite messy and required cleaning. The coordinates for each of the weather stations were obtained and separated into folders. Within each of the weather station files, the averages of the data columns, namely the temperatures, dew point, and relative humidities columns, were obtained. This normalization of data to a value of zero to one ensures that during training, there will not be any errors that come up when predicting new values. Each of the normalized values were then appended into a dictionary for machine learning training. Originally, our team tried to train the weather station files in one single large data set, however it was too much for a computer to handle, so splitting it up to dictionaries ensure that it was able to run very smoothly. The outputs of the pre-processing workflow are the CSV file for the grid distances and a CSV for the normalized weather station values. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/2Trees.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/3Grid_data.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/4station_id.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/5coord.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/6weather_dict.png\" /></p>\n<p>Using PyTorch, the team set the main target for the prediction as the temperature and main features as relative humidity and dew point. A sequence for the LSTM was created and set as default the 10 time steps. The team did not change the parameter values too much, as the team followed the documentation's recommendations. The hidden size was changed to about 8 layers and 200 epochs, which are how many iterations one wants the program to run through the training and ensures that the program is decently trained and not too overfitted. After training each of the weather station files independently, they are all appended into one single data frame to obtain the average prediction results for each of the stations.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/7station_loop.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/8station_results.png\" /></p>\n<p>The distance vectors obtained from each of the approximately 1300 different grid points mentioned earlier were used for the actual Geo-Kriging part of the project. The model is based off the random forest regression because random forest typically works well with a lot of different types of parameters, especially if the data turns out to be non linear.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/9features.png\" />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/10regression.png\" /></p>\n<p>The team finally fit the model with these parameters to obtain a temperature graph displaying the heat distribution of Georgia Tech's campus. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"Figures/11output.png\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"future-work\">Future Work</h2>\n<p>The team would like to run further validation studies on the model to ensure its functionality in different climates and with consistent data. As the NUS ran their model using a month's data, given steady annual temperature data, and our weather station data is inconsistent, the model should be continute to be validated before considered for further application.</p>\n<p>To enhance the robustness and applicability of the LSTM-Kriging Model for urban weather generation, the following future developments are proposed:\n1.  Accuracy Validation</p>\n<p>A critical next step is to rigorously test the accuracy of the model under various scenarios. Comparative analysis with existing models and observations will help assess the reliability and identify potential areas for refinement, including:</p>\n<p>\u2022   Assessing the model's predictions across various time scales, such as hourly, daily, and seasonal trends, to identify performance consistency over short- and long-term periods. </p>\n<p>\u2022   Performing a detailed breakdown of prediction errors to uncover biases or patterns associated with specific weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and urban contexts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Handling Missing Data</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Addressing missing data in weather and spatial datasets remains a key challenge. Future work will focus on integrating advanced imputation techniques or machine learning methods to fill data gaps effectively without compromising the model's performance, including:</p>\n<p>\u2022   Using diffusion models to reconstruct missing data patterns.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generalizability Testing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The model will be tested on additional university campuses with contexts similar to Georgia Tech, particularly those featuring comparable weather station setups and spatial characteristics. This will help evaluate the model's adaptability to different urban microclimates and provide insights for broader applications. </p>\n<h2 id=\"reference\">Reference</h2>\n<p>Jintong Han, Adrian Chong, Joie Lim, Savitha Ramasamy, Nyuk Hien Wong, Filip Biljecki, (2024).

Getting Started</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:</li>\n<li>Python 3.x</li>\n<li>Libraries: <code>geopandas</code>, <code>pandas</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>shapely</code>, <code>math</code></li>\n<li>Public Transit Stop Data (GeoJSON) with service frequency information (data pulled from UrbanFootprint and Mobility Database).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4 id=\"3-core-components\">3. Core Components</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Walk Access Time</strong>:<br />\n  Time taken to walk from a Point-of-Interest (POI) to a Service Access Point (SAP) like a bus stop or rail station.</li>\n<li>Walk speed: 80 meters/minute (4.8 km/hr).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Max distances: 640m for buses, 960m for rail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Service Frequency and Reliability</strong>:<br />\n  Number of transit services per hour.</p>\n</li>\n<li>Add 2 minutes reliability penalty for buses.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add 0.75 minutes reliability penalty for rail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Equivalent Doorstep Frequency (EDF)</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Formula:<br />\n    $$\n    EDF = \\frac{30}{\\text{Walk Time} + \\text{Average Waiting Time}}\n    $$</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accessibility Index (AI)</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calculation: Sum of EDFs, with secondary routes discounted by 50% to avoid overrepresentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PTAL Level Assignment</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Accessibility Index values are normalized similar to other subindices.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4 id=\"4-ptal-calculation-workflow\">4. PTAL Calculation Workflow</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong>:</li>\n<li>Load POIs (e.g., block groups).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Load Transit Stops with service frequency attributes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Walk Access Calculation</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Filter stops within the walking thresholds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Access Time and EDF Calculation</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Compute walk time and average waiting time.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Calculate EDF for each nearby route.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Accessibility Index Computation</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sum EDFs, applying 50% discount to non-dominant routes per transport mode.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PTAL Assignment</strong>:</p>\n</li>\n<li>Assign final PTAL levels based on AI bands.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4 id=\"5-outputs\">5. Outputs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Final outputs are available as CSV and GeoJSON files with PTAL scores for each geographic unit.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4 id=\"6-challenges\">6. Challenges</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited transit stop data coverage in non-dense areas.</li>\n<li>Incomplete GTFS feeds for certain systems.</li>\n<li>Simplified pedestrian network modeling.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"6-limitations\"><strong>6. Limitations</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Data Quality and Completeness</strong>:<br />\n  PEI heavily relies on OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and census datasets, which may have missing or outdated entries, especially outside major urban centers.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simplified Walkability</strong>:<br />\n  Current PEI calculations assume basic walk access without modeling detailed pedestrian barriers (e.g., highways, rivers, unsafe crossings).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transit Data Challenges</strong>:<br />\n  PTAL relies on accurate service frequency data, which is often incomplete, inconsistent, or missing for certain cities or transit providers.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 id=\"7-future-work\"><strong>7. Future Work</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate complete GTFS schedule data for previous years.</li>\n<li>Merge with walkability indices like PEI for a full mobility landscape.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"10-spring-2025-aditions-nationwide-data-generation-for-dr-ku\"><strong>10.

in making energy-informed design decisions early in the building process. The plugin enables users to create or modify building models and receive predictions for heating and cooling loads using a machine learning (ML) model. Architects can gauge building energy performance early (concept stage) using the Rhino Energy Prediction Plugin. The plugin embeds a self-contained ONNX runtime directly in Grasshopper.</p>\n<h2 id=\"features\">Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Model Initialization</strong><br />\n  Reads an ONNX model file path and sets up an <code>InferenceSession</code> that exposes each input tensor\u2019s name, datatype, and shape.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Real-Time Inference</strong><br />\n  Packs Grasshopper inputs into dense tensors, executes the ONNX model, and returns the first element of the output array as an energy load estimate.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automatic Feature Extraction</strong><br />\n  Companion Python script reads 3D building geometry and computes features such as roof area, window-to-wall ratio, floor area, and number of stories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Pure C# Runtime</strong><br />\n  Runs entirely in .NET via Microsoft\u2019s ONNX Runtime\u2014no Python interpreter required at inference time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"architecture\">Architecture</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Component Initialization</strong><br />\n   The plugin reads the ONNX model path from the Grasshopper input.<br />\n   It then creates an <code>InferenceSession</code> and retrieves input tensor metadata.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Input Packing</strong><br />\n   Grasshopper values are loaded into dense tensors that match the ONNX input shapes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Model Inference</strong><br />\n   The plugin runs the ONNX model with the packed inputs and receives an output array.<br />\n   The first element of that array is sent to the Grasshopper output.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Feature Extraction Script</strong><br />\n   A Python helper extracts building features automatically by classifying layers named <code>Wall</code>, <code>Slab</code>, <code>Window</code>, and <code>Roof</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"installation\">Installation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <code>VIP_Energy_Plugin</code>

We then categorize them into specific subdomains: for mental health, the categories include depression, anxiety, and PTSD; for well-being, the categories cover psychological, social, physical well-being, and life satisfaction. Following this, we identify the instruments used to assess these outcomes\u2014such as questionnaires or surveys\u2014and specify the exact measurement tools applied. Among the reviewed studies, 37 focus exclusively on well-being, 16 exclusively on mental health, and 9 address both.</p>\n<h3 id=\"main-findings\">Main Findings</h3>\n<p><div class=\"language-text highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span id=\"__span-3-1\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-1\" name=\"__codelineno-3-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-1\"></a>Main Findings\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-2\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-2\" name=\"__codelineno-3-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-2\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Aims/Research Questions\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-3\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-3\" name=\"__codelineno-3-3\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-3\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Main Findings\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-4\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-4\" name=\"__codelineno-3-4\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-4\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Statistical methods used\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-5\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-5\" name=\"__codelineno-3-5\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-5\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Effect Size (if reported)\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-6\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-6\" name=\"__codelineno-3-6\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-6\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Strengths\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-7\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-7\" name=\"__codelineno-3-7\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-7\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Limitations\n</span><span id=\"__span-3-8\"><a id=\"__codelineno-3-8\" name=\"__codelineno-3-8\" href=\"#__codelineno-3-8\"></a>\u251c\u2500\u2500 Policy Implications\n</span></code></pre></div>\n<img alt=\"statistic_method\" src=\"Figure/statistic_method.png\" /> </p>\n<p>Finally, we extract the \u201cmain findings\u201d section from each study, focusing on the research aim, statistical methods, effect sizes, strengths, limitations, and policy implications.

The simulation models agent movement across census tracts within the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metro region, with agents seeking to move optimally (seeking 'attractive' census tracts) based on various factors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"intro-and-description\">Intro and Description</h2>\n<p>This project is based on the reference paper created by Dr. Martinez and Dr. Zhao, which aims to address the following: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does the layout of transportation infrastructure affect the demographics of nearby neighborhoods? </li>\n<li>Does the creation of these infrastructure actually benefit everyone equally; is it fair? </li>\n<li>Can we predict the effects on surrounding communities before these structures are actually built? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These questions are primarily motivated by the issue of gentrification, an issue prevalent in many major cities. We utilized concepts in game theory, more specifically no-regret dynamics, in order to simulate the effects of the Atlanta Beltline on gentrification. To summarize our approach with no-regret dynamics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>People, or 'agents', randomly move from region to region. Depending the region's attributes, a <strong>'cost'</strong> value is assigned to each action. </li>\n<li><em>'Cost' is a function of region attractiveness, affordability, and community.</em> </li>\n<li>The higher the cost, the less likely an agent is to visit that census tract in the future. </li>\n<li>This process is repeated until the probability distribution of visting census tracts converges - an equilibrium is reached, and further actions make no difference. </li>\n<li>We compute the simulation convergance using the <em>total\u2011variation distance</em> between two sliding windows of recent agent\u2011distributions: \n<div class=\"language-text highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span id=\"__span-2-1\"><a id=\"__codelineno-2-1\" name=\"__codelineno-2-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-2-1\"></a>\\mathrm{TV}(p,q)\\;=\\;\\tfrac12\\sum_{c}\\lvert\\,p(c)-q(c)\\rvert\\,.\n</span></code></pre></div>\n  If TV\u00a0\u2264\u00a0<code>EPS_CONVERGENCE</code> (default\u202f=\u202f0.005) the system is deemed converged and the run halts automatically.

To do this in a way that accurately represents real-world distributions, we turned to the four-step model, a common trip generation algorithm: </p>\n<p><img width=\"758\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 2 19 28\u202fPM\" src=\"./Figures/FourStepModel.png\"></p>\n<p>The model has four components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trip Generation: This part of the model estimates the number of trips originating from or destined for a specific area. It focuses on understanding how many trips are generated rather than specific travel patterns. This process usually involves some type of data pertaining to the area at hand, such as demographics, income, or land usage.</li>\n<li>Trip Distribution; This part of the model estimates the number of trips for routes that go from an area to another, as determined in the trip generation step. This process is typically done using the gravity model, which assumes that the number of trips are positively correlated with the attractiveness of an area and inversely correlated to distance.</li>\n<li>Mode Choice: This part of the model determines the mode of transporation used to make the trips. This is typically done by considering demographic data (such as the percentage of people with cars) in an area.</li>\n<li>Route Assignment: This part of the model determines the routes travelers take between origins and destinations. This is typically done by considering the route that takes the shorted possible time, and following that. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our approach closely follows these four components. We first generate trips by considering the amenity density of areas. We sum up all amenity densities, and divide each area's density by this sum to generate a probability. We then utilize a Poisson Distribution to generate the number of trips by multipling a base number of trips by the probability. We then consider trip distribution through a modified gravity model. The equation for our model is the following, given that we aim to go from area/region i to j:</p>\n<p><img width=\"686\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-03 at 2 37 56\u202fPM\" src=\"./Figures/GravityModel.png\"></p>\n<p>We essentially multiply the total number of trips from area i to area j with the net amenity score for the destination j times transportation cost for that specific trip from area i to j, divided by the net amenity score for area j times the transportation cost from area i to j summed up over all destination j's. </p>\n<p>For our modal split, we assume that the car ownership rate is 0.7, and that the transit rate is 0.3. Each region's trips are split based on this. We then assign these routes based on the shortest possible distance.</p>\n<p>Through this process, we were able to have a methodical way of distributing the agents across Atlanta based on area factors such as amenity density.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tigerline-geodatabases-shapefiles\">TIGER/Line Geodatabases shapefiles:</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"Figures/ZIP_URLs.png\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"project-status\">Project status</h2>\n<h3 id=\"outputs-configuration\">Outputs &amp; configuration</h3>\n<p>Our code outputs a GIF to visualize agent behavior over time.

We create this distribution of wealth using Census data (population &amp; median incomes), to represent real-world demographics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"atlanta-beltline-in-our-simulation\">Atlanta Beltline in our Simulation</h2>\n<p>We automate the process of labelling certain regions as 'in the Atlanta Beltline' by using commuting paths from OpenStreetMap that correspond to the Atlanta Beltline - namely, a bike trail and a railway. To experiment with a different beltline, such as a beltline that spanned across Atlanta horizontally, or simply expanded north by x miles, we would acquire the OpenStreetMap ID's of existing paths (bike trails, walking paths, roads, etc.) corresponding to our desired Beltline, and paste these into <strong>config.py</strong>. Alternatively, we can create a such path ourselves in OpenStreetMap.\nThen, any region containing segments of these trails would automatically be marked as \"In the Atlanta Beltline\". </p>\n<p>In <strong>config.py</strong> - bike trail and railroad OpenStreetMap ID's for the beltline are as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"language-python highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span id=\"__span-5-1\"><a id=\"__codelineno-5-1\" name=\"__codelineno-5-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-5-1\"></a><span class=\"sd\">&quot;&quot;&quot; Beltline &#39;relation&#39; IDs from Open Street Map &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>\n</span><span id=\"__span-5-2\"><a id=\"__codelineno-5-2\" name=\"__codelineno-5-2\" href=\"#__codelineno-5-2\"></a><span class=\"n\">RELATION_IDS</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">8408433</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">13048389</span><span class=\"p\">]</span>\n</span></code></pre></div>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Bike Trail</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">Railroad</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"./Figures/BeltlineBikeTrail.png\" width=\"300\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"./Figures/BeltlineRailroad.png\" width=\"300\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Compare with Atlanta Beltline geography:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./Figures/AtlantaBeltlineVisual.jpg\" width=\"250\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"adapting-the-model-to-other-cities\">Adapting the Model to Other Cities</h2>\n<p>Although Atlanta serves as our case study, every pipeline stage\u2014census shapefiles, OSM\u2011derived amenities, cost parameters, and even the BeltLine decision\u2011agent\u2014can be swapped for a different region:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Geometry &amp; Demographics</strong><br />\n   \u2022 Replace the Fulton/DeKalb TIGER/Line shapefiles with those of your target city.<br />\n   \u2022 Point the <code>MEDIAN_INCOME_URL</code> and <code>POP_URL</code> in <code>config.py</code> to that city\u2019s American Community Survey \"ACS\" tables.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Transit\u2011Ring Definition</strong><br />\n   \u2022 Identify (or sketch in OSM) the planned loop / BRT corridor / rail spur you want to study, then list its OSM relation IDs in <code>config.py</code>.<br />\n   \u2022 The same \u03b2\u2011taper and DecisionAgent logic will assign accessibility boosts and density bonuses around the new corridor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Policy Levers</strong><br />\n   \u2022 Tweak <code>RHO_SCALAR</code> to explore how strong the up\u2011zoning response should be for the above transit ring.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because the simulation is purely data\u2011driven, you can rapidly prototype \u201cwhat\u2011if\u201d BeltLine analogues for <strong>anywhere with open census and OSM data while measuring potential community shifts/gentrification before shovels hit the ground.</strong>\nExample:\n<img alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"Figures/OldZipURL.png\" />\n* By changing the above URL, we get the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"./Figures/AtlantaBeltlineCloseupGraph.png\" alt=\"Alt text\"\n     width=\"250\" /></p>\n<h2 id=\"policy-scenarios-vertical-vs-horizontal-scaling\">Policy Scenarios: Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling</h2>\n<p>The simulation now supports two high-level policy experiments:</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-vertical-scaling-decision-making-agent-learns-m\">1.

For instance, our code can easily be ran on other regions, with customizable 'Beltlines' and the definitio. It simply needs lists of agents, a NetworkX graph, and other generalized parameters to operate. Furthermore, Our approach is backed by established human behavior approaches (no-regret dynamics), utilizes a distribution system that is also established (four-step model). We are able to produce dynamic visuals (GIFs).</p>\n<h3 id=\"weaknesses\">Weaknesses</h3>\n<p>Our simulation also assumes that there is no immigration/emigration in Atlanta, as we set a fixed number of agents. We also limit transportation choices to cars and public transportation, despite other modes of transport being popular (walking or biking) Additionally, our runtimes are relatively long due to the computationally expensive nature of the simulation. Ideally, our simulation would be ran in just a couple minutes or even seconds.</p>\n<h3 id=\"next-steps\">Next Steps</h3>\n<p>We hope to publish this research paper by this coming Fall semester. Most notably, we hope to improve the readability of our GIF's, improve the runtime of the simulation, validate our simulation's accuracy, and include additional visualizations of our results to better communicate our analysis during discussion. </p>\n<h2 id=\"presentation\">Presentation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sxJBZpCphA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n

While effective for large-scale assessments, these methods often overlook the influence of microclimatic conditions\u2014such as localized air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind flow\u2014which can vary significantly across urban environments due to morphological heterogeneity. This simplification limits the accuracy of energy predictions, particularly in dense and diverse urban contexts where microclimate dynamics play a critical role in shaping building energy performance. Recent studies have underscored the importance of integrating microclimate factors into UBEM, noting that urban heat island intensity, surface radiation balance, and convective conditions can substantially alter thermal loads at the building level. However, the lack of standardized methods for extracting and quantifying microclimatic variables at scale has constrained their application in mainstream UBEM workflows. To address this gap, this research develops a standardized data pipeline to systematically construct urban-scale datasets that incorporate both building attributes and localized microclimate indicators. Leveraging this dataset, statistical modeling techniques are employed to evaluate the relative influence of various microclimatic factors on building energy consumption. This work not only enhances our understanding of the interplay between urban form, climate, and energy use, but also offers a methodological foundation for future data-driven UBEM studies seeking to improve predictive accuracy and inform resilient urban energy planning.</p>\n<h1 id=\"satellite-data-collection\">Satellite data collection</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Method</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The satellite data acquisition pipeline is adapted and enhanced from the methodological framework proposed in prior New York City studies (Dougherty &amp; Jain, 2023). For each building, local environmental conditions are characterized within a 100 m radius to capture neighborhood-scale microclimatic influences. Specifically, the original building footprint is first simplified using a convex hull algorithm to reduce geometric complexity while preserving its spatial extent. A 100 m radial buffer is then generated around the convex hull to define the final sampling domain for microclimate feature extraction. Satellite-derived environmental variables with native spatial resolutions ranging from 10 m to 2.5 km are processed and resampled within Google Earth Engine to a unified 100 m spatial scale. This resampling strategy ensures spatial consistency across heterogeneous data sources and guarantees that each building-level buffer reliably captures representative pixel-level microclimate information. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Microclimate information</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We place particular emphasis on vegetation coverage in the surroundings of each building. In a previous study, we investigated the relationship between the urban tree canopy ratio and building energy consumption (Xu et al. 2025). In the present work, we adopt the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the primary indicator to characterize the greenness of the local built environment. Compared with canopy ratio metrics derived from land-cover classifications, NDVI offers a key advantage in its ability to explicitly capture seasonal variations in vegetation phenology, which is critical for subsequent analyses under representative summer and winter conditions. NDVI data are obtained from the ECOSTRESS Tiled Ancillary NDVI and Albedo L2 Global 70 m V002 product. </p>\n<p>For integrated microclimatic conditions surrounding each building, including air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, we utilize data from RTMA (Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis), a high-resolution near-surface atmospheric analysis system provided by NOAA and generated through real-time data assimilation of surface observations and numerical weather prediction outputs. In addition, to characterize nocturnal urban activity and radiative intensity, which serve as indirect proxies for urban vitality and anthropogenic carbon emissions, we employ the VIIRS Stray Light Corrected Nighttime Day/Night Band Composites Version 1 product to extract nighttime radiance information. </p>\n<p>Our completed dataset can be found <a href=\"data/2025_1120_Microclimate%20data.xlsx\">here</a>, and an introduction to each variable can be found <a href=\"data/Mircoclimate%data%introduction.docx\">here</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sky view factor</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"building-facade-data-collection\">Building facade data collection</h1>\n<h1 id=\"reference\">Reference</h1>\n<p>Dougherty, T.

I will begin by explaining the concepts necessary to understand spatial autocorrelation, specifically for Local Moran's I. It's important to understand that spatial autocorrelation is used to calculate the community score and if you are unsure what community score represents or the justification for it, then see the general readME. This readme is speficially for community score's implementation. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"the-math\">The Math</h2>\n<h3 id=\"local-morans-i\">Local Moran's I</h3>\n<p>Spatial Autocorrelation is a geographic concept for finding clusters of similarity or dissimilarity in geographic data. The most common formula is <strong>Local Moran's I</strong>:</p>\n<div class=\"arithmatex\">\\[\nI_i = \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})}{m_2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{ij} (x_j - \\bar{x})\n\\]</div>\n<p>Where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(\\( x_i \\)\\)</span>\\)</span>: value of the variable at location <em>i</em>  (agent endowments)</li>\n<li><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(\\( \\bar{x} \\)\\)</span>\\)</span>: mean of all <span class=\"arithmatex\">\\( x \\)</span> values (average endowments of all agents)</li>\n<li><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(\\( w_{ij} \\)\\)</span>\\)</span>: spatial weight between locations <em>i</em> and <em>j</em>   (morans weights)</li>\n<li><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(\\( n \\)\\)</span>\\)</span>: total number of observations</li>\n<li><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(\\( m_2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\)\\)</span>\\)</span>: variance normalization term</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(<span class=\"arithmatex\">\\(I_i\\)</span>\\)</span> represents the value of morans for the specific agent. In our case, we can obtain the \"community score\" by calculating the local moran's value for that agent and normalizing this value to be between 0 and 1. While this formula is how Moran's I runs, our simulation uses esda.local_moran, instead of manually implementing the math. In order to do this, we need to form our own weights value and way of tracking endowments for each agent to give to esda. <strong>Importantly, the weights matrix is per census tract and represents the weights between census tracts, while agent endowments are per agent.</strong></p>\n<h3 id=\"neighbors\">Neighbors</h3>\n<p>In the pure mathematical form of Local Moran's I, every node is compared with every other node in the set. However, this is computationally expensive and also causes odd behavior around edges (see Appendix A). The common alternate approach is to only consider neighbors. So if a census tract is touching 6 other census tracts, then that tract has 6 neighbors to compare with and effectively only those 6 neighbors impact the agent's community score. Another common approach is to use decay over the entire set of nodes. So every node is a \u201cneighbor,\u201d but the Moran\u2019s weights reflect that closer neighbors have a stronger impact on the community of a node.</p>\n<p>For our simulation we use a K-nearest neighbors approach, which sets a fixed set of neighbors - that we can configure for each simulation - and then uses decay. So if we set neighbors to 20, then the closest 20 nodes are neighbors with the closer ones counting more. We chose this because it\u2019s much faster than a full decay (with full decay you have to iterate over 500 nodes for every moran\u2019s calculation for each node), but reflects that people\u2019s perception of their neighborhood extends further than 10-20 minutes away from them. The decay should remain high.</p>\n<p>(add in picture of neighbor png here)</p>\n<h3 id=\"normalization\">Normalization</h3>\n<p>Normalization is important for local morans because the raw values for morans can vary without range. They often are negative and they are not constrained to any range. Community score, however, does need to be constrained from 0 to 1. Therefore, we need a way to constrain our morans values to between 0 and 1. </p>\n<p>Our original approach was to use z-score-to-cdf. This means we first take the morans values we calculate and perform a z-score normalization (this is standard in statistics) and then map those values to [0,1] using CDF which conceptually is like saying \u201cthis is the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile value in our simulation so the value is really 0.9\u201d. The issue with this was that it causes more extreme values if the moran\u2019s values have a low standard deviation. </p>\n<p>The new approach is to use a direct mapping after z-score. The equation for that is simply:</p>\n<div class=\"arithmatex\">\\[\np_i = \\frac{z_i - \\min(z)}{\\max(z) - \\min(z)}\n\\]</div>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT, this is currently not reflected in the main branch of the code. We\u2019ll need to update this if we go back to moran\u2019s</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-simulation\">The Simulation</h2>\n<h2 id=\"morans_analysispy\">Morans_analysis.py</h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s go through

The library call accepts the entire city, which is not the most efficient, but otherwise we would need 4 or 5 input parameters from the city, so this is simpler.\nThe code itself ensures that a spatial weights matrix (W) exists, which is essential for computing Local Moran\u2019s I.</p>\n<p>Spatial weights define which regions (or agents) are considered neighbors and how strongly they influence each other. The code first checks whether these weights already exist (as a tract-level NumPy matrix on the city object). If not, it dynamically builds them from cached distance data.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Using Precomputed Tract Weights</li>\n<li>If the city object already provides a tract-level distance matrix (morans_weights):</li>\n<li>The code verifies that all values are finite (no NaNs or infinities).</li>\n<li>It converts the NumPy distance matrix into a Libpysal W object, the standard spatial weights format used by the PySAL ecosystem.</li>\n<li>Each tract\u2019s row is converted into a dictionary mapping neighbor indices \u2192 weight values.</li>\n<li>Finally, the matrix is row-standardized (w_obj.transform = \"r\"), so each row sums to 1.</li>\n<li>\n<p>This path is used when a ready-made Moran\u2019s weights matrix is already available (for example, from prior preprocessing or caching).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Building Weights from Cached Distances</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the city object doesn\u2019t have a precomputed weights matrix (w is None), the method builds one on the fly:</p>\n</li>\n<li>It loads a precomputed centroid distance matrix from neighbors.npy, which stores pairwise distances between tracts.</li>\n<li>It constructs a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) structure (self.cached_KNN), where each tract is connected to its SPATIAL_K_NEIGHBORS closest neighbors.</li>\n<li>If a cached Libpysal W object (self.cached_W) doesn\u2019t exist yet, it calls _ensure_cached_W_from_distances() to create it.</li>\n<li>This helper computes inverse-distance weights, so closer tracts have stronger influence.</li>\n<li>The resulting matrix is also row-standardized.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After these steps, the method guarantees that a valid Libpysal W object (w) exists \u2014 ready for use in the Local Moran\u2019s I calculation that follows.</p>\n<p><div class=\"language-python highlight\"><pre><span></span><code><span id=\"__span-1-1\"><a id=\"__codelineno-1-1\" name=\"__codelineno-1-1\" href=\"#__codelineno-1-1\"></a><span

is where the actual morans/gearys happens. Here we determine which Spatial Autocorrelation algorithm to use and then run that using the library. The '0 permutations' means the library only runs once. \nYou can set a higher amount of permutations and then calculate means, medians, standard deviations, etc... but we choose not to do this because every permutation slows the simulation down. Then we make sure the data is in the right format \nand uses the correct normalization. Then when we 'map tract-level scores to per-agent scores', this ensures that the agents recieve the correct score for their track.</p>\n<p>The issue with this is that all agents in the tract will recieve the same morans score. The library runs on a node basis not an agent basis, which means we have to manipulate the data to get the results we want. There's a few potential ways to convert tract-level\nmorans to agent-level morans. Potentially, you can add a faux tract with the same distances as the real tract the agent is and then set the endowment of the faux tract to the endowment of the agent. The issue with this is it requires a loop for every agent\nwhich means if there's N agents, then you need to run the library-morans N times, which is far too slow to be useful.Another way is to not use the library and instead do the calculations manually, which leaves more error for potential coding issues and will also\nbe slower than the regular library due to the library's optimizations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"presentation\">Presentation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6XC36CP5ew\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\n    <img
