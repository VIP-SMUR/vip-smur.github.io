        "1": " Psychosocial and Neighborhood Correlates of Health-Related Quality of Life: A Multi-Level Study Among Hispanic Adults Objective: Improvement in health-related quality of life  is a public health goal of Healthy People . Hispanics living in the United States are at risk for poor HRQoL, but the causes and correlates of this risk are not well understood. Thus, the present study examined individual-level psychosocial and neighborhood-level built environment correlates of physical and mental HRQoL among Hispanic adults. Method: A community sample of Hispanic adults  completed self-report health-related questionnaires, and census tract was used to collect data on neighborhood-level built environment variables. Multilevel modeling was used to examine individual-level psychosocial  and neighborhood-level built-environment  correlates of physical and mental HRQoL. : Higher subjective social status was significantly associated with better HRQoL, and more experiences with discrimination were significantly associated with lower HRQoL. For physical HRQoL, these relationships were stronger in neighborhoods with a higher density of tobacco retail outlets. s: Findings from this study suggest that subjective social status and discrimination play important roles in HRQoL among Hispanics, in particular in neighborhoods with a higher density of tobacco retail outlets. This study highlights the importance of considering neighborhood context, and in particular neighborhood disadvantage, when examining the relationship between social status, discrimination and HRQoL among Hispanics.\n\n social ecological model, health-related quality of life, built environment, Hispanics\n\nImprovement in health-related quality of life , defined as an individual's perceived mental and physical health, is a public health goal of Healthy People  . In the United States, HRQoL\nvaries by race/ethnicity . Twenty-eight percent of Hispanics report fair or poor HRQoL, more than double the rate of non-Hispanic Whites . Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority group in the United States and are expected to reach \n\nProgram in Clinical Psychology ; therefore, improvement in HRQoL among Hispanics is critical to improving the health of the nation. Hispanics are a diverse population with varied psychosocial experiences and neighborhood environments that can shape HRQoL. Given this heterogeneity, there is a need to identify whom among this ethnic group suffers from low HRQoL and under what neighborhood conditions this occurs. Thus, the present study used an ecological approach to examine individual-level psychosocial and neighborhood-level built environment correlates of HRQoL among Hispanic adults living in the United States.",
        "2": " Social Ecological Framework\n\nThe social ecological model is a framework for understanding how individual characteristics, and the larger social systems in which individuals live, interact to influence health outcomes . The social ecological model proposes that HRQoL has multiple levels of influence, including individual, community, and policy-level factors, among others, and that these determinants interact with one another to shape HRQoL . According to this framework, contextualizing an individual's attitudes, beliefs, and practices is critical to understanding their relationship with HRQoL.\n\nThe social ecological model represents a shift from an individually oriented analysis of health in community health promotion research . This model stands in contrast to traditional health behavior theories that predominantly focus on how an individual's choices affect health, and that fail to consider the role of the broader context in which health-related choices are made. This shift is, in part, a response to the failure of some health promotion programs that focused solely on individual cognitive or behavioral modification . The negligible impacts of these interventions suggested limitations in traditional heath behavior models . The social ecological framework recognizes that there are a myriad of factors outside of an individual's beliefs and behaviors that influence health.\n\nConsidering the role of the environment in health, the social ecological model provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding determinants of health. In addition, the social ecological model allows for more comprehensive interventions to be developed that target mechanisms to improve health at multiple levels of influence. A critical aspect of the model is that health is impacted by multiple levels of influence  and that these levels are interactive and reinforcing and can have cumulative effects on health . For example, chronic exposure to tobacco retailers may increase the negative impacts of depression on health by facilitating access to cigarettes as a coping mechanism for depressed mood. An intervention to improve health in this case may be most effective if it targets both individual-level factors associated with mood as well as promotes an environment in which healthy choices for coping with low mood can be more easily made.",
        "3": " Psychosocial Influences\n\nAt the individual level, the present study explores the relationships between several psychosocial constructs that have been associated with HRQoL among Hispanics. These include  acculturation,  religiosity,  subjective social status, and  perceived discrimination.",
        "4": " Acculturation\n\nAcculturation plays a critical role in health among Hispanics . Although several definitions of acculturation have been proposed, most view acculturation as a process of behavior and attitude change as a result of contact with another culture . To date, most studies have found higher levels of acculturation to be adversely associated with health and health behaviors  among Hispanics . Research examining the relationship between acculturation and HRQoL among Hispanics has largely been undertaken in clinical samples, precluding generalizability to community samples . The few studies undertaken in non-clinical Hispanic samples have had mixed findings regarding the relationship between acculturation and HRQoL. For example, one study found higher levels of acculturation were associated with worse physical HRQoL, but there was no significant relationship with mental HRQoL . However, another study in a community sample found higher levels of acculturation to be associated with better mental and overall HRQoL . Research is needed to clarify previous findings and to extend what is known about the relationship between acculturation and mental and physical HRQoL. The present study uses two widely used proxy measures of acculturation, language preference and the number of years lived in the United States, to examine an individual's level of acculturation .",
        "5": " Religiosity\n\nMany studies show that greater religiosity is associated with better mental and physical health . Religiosity is a broad term that refers to the extent to which one participates in the beliefs and practices of religion . Religiosity is believed to be associated with health through several psychosocial mechanisms such as social support, health practices, and psychosocial resources , for example. The strongest relationships between religiosity and health have been found for attendance at religious services . Attendance at religious activities may facilitate social support, which, in turn, has been shown to promote and protect health. Previous research examining the relationship between religiosity and HRQoL among Hispanics suggests that religiosity and spirituality is positively associated with several aspects of HRQoL including social and functional wellbeing ; however, these studies have been largely limited to clinical populations. The majority of Hispanics report that religion is important to them, highlighting the importance of understanding the relationship between religion and HRQoL in community samples .",
        "6": " Subjective Social Status\n\nSubjective social status has been defined as \"a person's belief about his location in a status order\" . The concept of subjective social status is believed to consist of more than just socioeconomic variables like education, income, or occupation. Subjective social status is believed to also include a personal assessment of one's social standing. In addition, this construct not only incorporates an assessment of one's present and past, but also takes into account future opportunities .\n\nPrevious studies have found significant, positive relationships between subjective social status and HRQoL . Few studies, however, have examined this relationship among Hispanics. Franzini and Fernandez-Esquer  found that subjective social status was significantly, positively associated with mental and physical HRQoL in a sample of , Mexican-origin men and women living in in Texas. Another study found that subjective social status was significantly, positively associated with self-rated health among pregnant Hispanic women . However, this relationship was no longer significant when controlling for education and household income.",
        "7": " Perceived Discrimination\n\nGreater perceived discrimination has been significantly associated with poorer HRQoL . Discrimination can impact health through psychological and behavioral mechanisms . Studies indicate that discrimination is associated with several mental and physical health issues like high blood pressure, depression, and lower perceived well-being . Although the literature on discrimination and HRQoL has grown, especially among African Americans, less research is available among Hispanics . Studies typically find discrimination to be significantly, positively associated with worse mental and physical HRQoL among Hispanics . A review of studies examining the relationship between discrimination and health noted, however, that a limitation of the literature is the often narrow conceptualization of discrimination used in studies and failure to assess discrimination comprehensively . The present study will extend what is known about the relationship between discrimination and HRQoL by using a comprehensive measure of discrimination that asks respondents about perceived discrimination in nine different contexts .",
        "8": " Neighborhood Environment\n\nThe relationship between psychosocial variables and HRQoL should be understood within an environmental context . Studies consistently show that the neighborhood environment in which one lives is associated with a range of health behaviors and outcomes such as smoking , diet , physical activity, and cardiovascular disease . Nonetheless, research examining the relationship between psychosocial variables and health has rarely considered the role of the neighborhood environment. Including neighborhood context in health research allows for a more nuanced understanding of this complex relationship.\n\nThe impact of the environment on health has previously been documented among minority populations, with greater neighborhood deprivation associated with worse self-rated health . The relationship between the neighborhood retail environment and health has received particular attention. The neighborhood retail environment can be used as a proxy to assess neighborhood deprivation. Neighborhoods with few supermarkets and grocery stores that offer healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables, and with many tobacco and alcohol retailers, may reflect neighborhood disadvantage because these areas allow greater opportunity to engage in unhealthy behaviors. For example, a study among an ethnically diverse sample of smokers in Houston, TX found that living within a short walking distance of a tobacco outlet was associated with lower likelihood of smoking abstinence . Another study among a community sample in Detroit, MI found that living in a neighborhood with a large grocery store was associated with consuming . more daily servings of fruit and vegetables, and that this relationship varied by race/ethnicity . Hispanics living in a neighborhood with a large grocery store consumed . more daily servings of fruits and vegetables as compared with African Americans living in a neighborhood with a large grocery store . Lovasi, Hutson, Guerra, and Neckerman  noted the important role the retail food environment plays in obesity among Hispanics because predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods in the United States tend to have fewer healthy food stores.\n\nDespite the significance of the neighborhood environment in health, there is a paucity of research that considers the role the neighborhood environment plays in the relationship between individual-level psychosocial factors and health among Hispanics. Adler and Stewart  recommended the study of moderators of the relationship between demographic characteristics and health in multilevel analyses, noting that the relationship between demographic characteristics and health is complex and may not be best explained by independent associations. For example, the relationship between acculturation and HRQoL may be stronger in places with many alcohol retailers because greater access to alcohol retailers may facilitate the use of alcohol as a way to cope with experiences of acculturation, and in turn, adversely impact health. Exploring the potential moderating role of the neighborhood environment may help to better understand the relationship between individual-level psychosocial factors and health.",
        "9": " Present Study\n\nThis study examined how individual-level psychosocial factors and the neighborhood environment relate to HRQoL among Hispanic adults living in the United States. There were three aims. The first aim was to examine the relationship of individual-level psychosocial variables to both physical and mental HRQoL. Several variables were examined:  acculturation,  religiosity, \nsubjective social status, and  perceived discrimination. The second aim was to examine the relationship between the neighborhood retail environment and HRQoL. Three aspects of the neighborhood retail environment were examined:  the retail food environment,  proximity to alcohol retailers, and  tobacco retailer density. The final aim was to examine if the neighborhood environment moderates the relationship between individuallevel psychosocial factors and HRQoL. Age, gender, and income were included as covariates in all models because previous literature has found significant relationships between these sociodemographic characteristics and HRQoL . Based on the social ecological framework, we hypothesized that the relationship between individual-level psychosocial variables and HRQoL would be moderated by the neighborhood retail environment.",
        "11": " Participants and Procedures\n\nParticipants were a community sample of Hispanic adults  in San Diego, CA. Participants were recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial that evaluated an educational video about clinical trials tailored for Hispanics. To be eligible for inclusion, individuals must have:  self-identified as Hispanic,  been at least  years of age,  been residents of the United States, and  been literate in English and/or Spanish. Eligible participants gave written consent and completed a survey packet of health-related questionnaires in their preferred language  at baseline in -, before randomization. Participants also provided their home address as part of the survey. Survey completion of the paper-and-pencil self-administered questionnaires took approximately  hr and participants received  $ for their time. The Institutional Review Boards of San Diego State University and University of California, San Diego approved all study procedures and materials before human subject enrollment.\n\nThe present study is a secondary data analysis of responses to survey questions from the parent study. Individual-level psychosocial measures were comprised of the following: Brief Acculturation Scale for Hispanics , Duke University Religion Index , MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status , the Experiences of Discrimination scale , and the number of years participants lived in the United States. Neighborhoodlevel retail environment measures included the Modified Retail Food Environment Index , proximity to an alcohol outlet, and tobacco outlet density.",
        "12": " Measures\n\nPsychosocial measures. Psychosocial data were obtained at the individual level. Data were gathered from responses to selfreport measures included in the survey packet.\n\nMacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status . The SSS is a self-anchoring visual scale in the form of a  -rung ladder. Participants were asked to place themselves on a rung of the ladder where they believe they stand relative to others.\n\nParticipants completed two ladders. On one, they compared themselves to other individuals within their community . On the other, they compared themselves to others in the United States . Scores for each single-item scale can range from  to  , with higher scores reflecting greater perceived subjective social status.\n\nDuke University Religion Index . The DUREL is a brief measure of religious involvement. The measure has three subscales that examine organizational religious activity, non-organizational religious activity, and intrinsic religiosity. The single-item organizational religious activity subscale was used in the present study. This subscale score ranges from  to  , with higher scores indicating more frequent organizational religious activity .\n\nBrief Acculturation Scale for Hispanics . The BASH is a four-item measure that uses language preference as a proxy for acculturation in Hispanics. Respondents select the language in which they think, speak at home, speak with friends, and read. Scores range from  to  , with higher scores indicating greater levels of acculturation . Internal consistency reliability was excellent in the present study .\n\nExperiences of Discrimination scale . The EOD scale is a nine-item self-report measure of racial/ethnic discrimination. Respondents select the frequency with which they have experienced discrimination in nine different contexts . Scores range from  to  , with higher scores reflecting more experiences with discrimination. Internal consistency reliability was very good in the present study .\n\nNeighborhood-level retail environment measures. Each participant's neighborhood-level data was obtained at the census tract level. The census tract in which a participant lived was determined based on the participant's reported home address. Census tracts were defined according to the U.S. Census Bureau and are considered to be relatively homogeneous units based on population characteristics . These data came from the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project  collected by the California Department of Public Health and the University of California, San Francisco and from the California State Board of Equalization.\n\nHealthy food retailers. The retail food environment was assessed using the Modified Retail Food Environment Index , an indicator developed by the CDC, which provides the percentage of healthy food retailers for each census tract. Healthy food retailers include supermarkets, large grocery stores, supercenters, and produce stores as defined by the North American Industry Classification Codes. Less healthy food retailers include fast-food restaurants, small grocery stores, and convenience stores as defined by North American Industry Classification Codes. Scores range from  to  , with higher scores indicating a healthier retail food environment. Data on the mRFEI analyzed in the present study were collected by the CDC and gathered from a publicly available database .\n\nProximity to alcohol outlets. Proximity to an alcohol outlet was defined as the percent of the population in a census tract within . miles of an alcohol outlet. Addresses of all establishments with active off-sale licenses  were obtained from the California Department of Alcohol\nand Beverage Control by HCI and geocoded using Browser Based Geocoder. Geocoded addresses were then imported into ArcMap. Buffers of one-quarter  mile were created around all alcohol establishments, and block data were then aggregated by census tract. Percent of the population in a census tract living within . miles of an alcohol outlet can range from  to  of the population. A higher percentage indicates that a greater percent of the population lives within close proximity to an alcohol outlet.\n\nDensity of tobacco outlets. The density of tobacco outlets was defined as the number of active tobacco retailers per square mile for each census tract . This was calculated by dividing the number of active tobacco retailers by the area in square miles for each census tract. A higher value indicates a greater density of tobacco outlets. Tobacco retailer data came from the California State Board of Equalization, which is responsible for collecting the state tax imposed on all tobacco products.\n\nHealth-related quality of life. HRQoL data were obtained at the individual level. HRQoL data were gathered from participant responses to the  -item Short Form Health Survey included in the survey packet.\n\n-Item Short Form Health Survey . The SF-, a short form of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey , was used to measure HRQoL. The SF- is a  -item self-report measure of HRQoL that assesses eight health domains. The SF- can yield two general scores: the physical component summary  and the mental component summary . The SF- PCS measures the following health domains: General Health, Physical Functioning, Role Physical, and Bodily Pain. The SF- MCS measures the following domains: Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health.  SF- scores were calculated using software from the measure's developers. SF- PCS and SF- MCS scores range from  to  , with higher scores indicating better HRQoL. The subscales were designed to have a mean of  and  of  in a sample representative of the U.S. population. Internal consistency reliability was good for the SF- MCS  and the SF- PCS  in the present study.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics. Information on participant age, gender, median household income, and number of years lived in the U.S. was gathered from participant responses in the survey packet.",
        "13": " Data Analysis Plan\n\nFirst, descriptive statistics were calculated for the total sample, and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine relationships among the psychosocial variables. Next, multilevel modeling tested the relationships of person-level psychosocial variables and neighborhood-level environment variables to mental and physical HRQoL . Separate models were examined for mental and physical HRQoL. A multilevel data structure contains observations at one level of analysis that are nested within observations at another level of analysis. A key component of multilevel modeling is that the data at different levels of analysis are interdependent . In the present study, multilevel modeling was used to account for clustering of individuals within neigh-\nborhoods. Age, gender, and income were controlled for in all analyses.\n\nMultilevel linear modeling proceeded in four phases, examining the:  intercept-only model,  random-regression coefficients model,  means-as-outcome model, and  intercepts- and slopes-as-outcomes model. To explain the proportion of variability in HRQoL attributable to clustering at the census tract level, the intercept-only model was evaluated. Next, to examine the relationship between person-level psychosocial variables and mental and physical HRQoL, the random-regression coefficients model was evaluated . In the random-regression coefficients model, psychosocial variables were included as the only predictors in the model. Separate models were run for each psychosocial variable. Psychosocial variables that were not significantly associated with mental or physical HRQoL at this step were not included in further analyses. Next, the means-as-outcome model was examined to assess the relationship between the neighborhood-level environment variables and mental and physical HRQoL, after controlling for the psychosocial variables . The means-as-outcome model includes both neighborhood predictor variables and psychosocial variables. Last, the intercepts- and slopes-as-outcomes model was examined to assess whether neighborhood moderated the relationship between person-level psychosocial variables and HRQoL. This last model included both person-level and neighborhood-level variables simultaneously, as well as a cross-level interaction term. To reduce Type II error, a  value of . was used to evaluate significance for the interaction terms because of the exploratory nature of the present study . Multilevel models were conducted in SPSS Version .",

        "17": "\n\nThe present study used an ecological approach to examine psychosocial  and neighborhood  factors associated with physical and mental HRQoL among Hispanics. The SF- PCS and SF- MCS scores were developed to have a mean score of  and a  of  in a population-based U.S. sample . A minimal clinically important difference  has not been established for the SF-; however, a MCID of three to five points has been recommended for the long-form SF- and both measures were designed\nto have the same score means,  s, and range . Hays and Morales , however, noted that previous studies have found clinically important changes in the SF- measure with differences in total scores as small as  points. Thus, participants in the present study  appear to have average physical HRQoL as compared with the overall U.S. population, but their average mental HRQoL  is . points lower than the value for the overall U.S. population, suggesting worse mental HRQoL to an extent that is clinically meaningful.\n\nHigher subjective social status compared with other people in one's community was associated with both better physical and mental HRQoL. Higher subjective social status compared with others in the United States was associated with better mental HRQoL, but not physical HRQoL. Overall, these findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown significant, positive relationships between subjective social status and HRQoL . Subjective social status has been related to health through sustained activation of the body's stress-response . The stress response can initiate physiological responses  that, over time, can negatively impact health. In addition to physiological mechanisms, subjective social status has been associated with health through psychosocial mediators. Psychosocial factors such as selfesteem and sense of control have been found to mediate the relationship between subjective social status and self-rated health . Future studies should examine psychosocial mediators of the relationship between subjective social status and health specifically among Hispanics, as psychosocial mediators may vary cross-culturally de-\npendent on the meaning and salience of these constructs for particular cultural groups .\n\nConsistent with previous research, more experiences with discrimination were associated with worse physical and mental HRQoL in the present study. Like subjective social status, discrimination has been related to physical and mental health through a mobilization of the body's stress response . In addition, discrimination has been shown to put individuals at greater risk for engaging in health behaviors  that provide short-term stress relief, but may have long-term negative impacts on health . Discrimination is a common experience among Hispanics in the United States with close to half of U.S.-born Hispanics and a quarter of the foreign-born reporting everyday discrimination . This research suggests the need for interventions that identify ways to buffer the relationship between discrimination and HRQoL among Hispanics.\n\nReligiosity and the commonly used proxy measures of acculturation, language preference and years lived in the United States, were not associated with physical or mental HRQoL. Religiosity may not have been associated with HRQoL because the measure used to assess the construct in the present study asked about how often respondents attended church and religious meetings. Religiosity has been linked to HRQoL through increased social support . Frequency of attendance at church and religious meetings may not well capture strength of relationships and support. In addition,  from this study provide insight into the inconsistent findings seen in the literature relating acculturation to health in Hispanics and highlight the importance of carefully selecting constructs to measure when examining acculturation. Proxy measures of acculturation are limited because they assume acculturation is reflected in the amount of exposure individuals have to the dominant culture . These measures often provide an incomplete picture of acculturation and fail to capture the intricacies of the process of cultural change . In addition, although not a primary focus of the study, consistent with prior research , higher income was significantly associated with better mental and physical HRQoL and older age was significantly associated with worse physical HRQoL.\n\nThere were no significant main effect relationships between the neighborhood retail environment and HRQoL. This may be a result of examining the relationship between particular aspects of the retail environment and HRQoL. Health outcomes are typically the result of multiple environmental issues simultaneously affecting individuals. The relationship between one aspect of the neighborhood environment and health is likely confounded by other neighborhood issues, potentially obstructing the ability to find a significant relationship between one particular aspect of the neighborhood environment and HRQoL . Future studies should consider the use of latent variables to combine different aspects of the neighborhood environment into more robust variables.\n\nAlthough there were no significant main effect relationships between the neighborhood retail environment and HRQoL in the present study, there were two significant cross-level interactions. Lower subjective social status as compared with one's community and more experiences with discrimination were both more strongly associated with worse physical HRQoL in neighborhoods with a higher density of tobacco retailers. Neighborhoods with a high density of tobacco retailers are typically areas where residents with\nlow socioeconomic status reside . Thus, this may suggest that subjective social status and discrimination have a stronger relationship to physical HRQoL in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Holding a negative view about oneself in comparison with others or feeling discriminated against may be particularly detrimental for HRQoL in disadvantaged neighborhoods where there may be more opportunity to engage in health-risk behaviors in an effort to cope with these challenges. For example, Hispanics living in neighborhoods with a high density of tobacco retailers may use smoking as a way to cope with discrimination and low socioeconomic status, potentially explaining the stronger relationship to physical HRQoL. This finding is of particular importance for Hispanics living in the United States given the marginalization and discrimination they may experience.\n\n should be interpreted while considering study limitations. Study participants were predominantly of Mexican descent and resided in a metropolitan border city in southern California, limiting the generalizability of study . In addition, the present study only examined the built environment in the census tract in which a participant lived. Examination of other spatial areas participants frequent  may provide further insight into the role the environmental context plays in physical and mental HRQoL. Finally, the study was a secondary analysis of crosssectional data, precluding determination of causality.\n\nIn summary, the present study examined the relationship between several psychosocial variables and HRQoL and considered the potential moderating role of the neighborhood built environment. Findings from this study suggest that subjective social status and discrimination play important roles in HRQoL among Hispanics, and this may be particularly true in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These findings help identify who among this group is in particular need of intervention to meet the Healthy People  goal of improving HRQoL in the United States . Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of considering neighborhood context when examining the relationship between social status, discrimination, and HRQoL among Hispanics."
