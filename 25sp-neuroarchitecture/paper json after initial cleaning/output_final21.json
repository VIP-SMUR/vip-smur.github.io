        "1": " Experiencing Urban Green and Blue Spaces in Urban Wetlands as a Nature-Based Solution to Promote Positive Emotions ",
        "4": " \n\nGreen and blue spaces are nature-based solutions  that evoke positive emotions of experiencers therein. There is an impetus to optimize wetland forest landscapes by planning the geographical arrangement of metrics that promote positive emotion. The facial expressions of nature experiencers in photos, downloaded from social media databases with landscape metrics, were evaluated for emotions and given scores. Happy and sad scores were rated by FireFACE v. software and positive response index  was calculated as happy score minus sad score. Spatial areas and tree height were evaluated from Landsat  images and digital model maps, respectively. Visitors at middle and senior ages smiled more frequently in southern parts than in northern parts, and females had higher happy scores and PRI than males. Both green- and blue-space areas had positive relationships with PRI scores, while blue spaces and their area to park area ratios had positive contributions to happy scores and PRI scores in multivariate linear regression models. Elevation had a negative relationship with positive facial emotion. Overall, based on spatial distributions of blue-space area and elevation, regional landscape was optimized so people perceived more happiness in wetlands around Zhejiang and Shanghai, while people in wetlands of Jiangxi and Hubei showed more net emotional expressions.\n\n\n landscape optimizing; nature-based solution; exposure to nature; ecosystem service; green space; blue space; human health and well-being",
        "5": " . \n\nThe increasing population increases the frequency of experiencing negative emotions due to more conflictual interactions between people, disappointment, insecurity, etc. These together contribute to a stressful atmosphere in current society and increase the risk of mental illness . According to the World Health Organization  , mental health burdens are increasing worldwide, with a  rise in mental health conditions from  to . Approximately one out of five people in post-conflict settings have a mental health condition. Depression and anxiety are the two most common mental health conditions, which together cost the global economy US\\$  trillion annually .\n\nMental stress is the root to impair our health and well-being. Stressors are perceived from mental distresses, which result from external factors such as social contact or natural experiences  . However, according to stress recovery theory , interacting with nature relieves stresses, but urban settings hamper recuperation . These effects were together concluded to be an outcome of ecosystem services in a city . City lifestyles contribute to a decrease in contact with nature due to more screen-time and less opportunities to interact with green spaces . Therefore, more frequent contact with nature was recommended as a NBS to improve mental health and well-being for psychiatry patients . Ordinary city dwellers, e.g., customers and travelers, share a common chance to perceive distresses and suffer bad moods. For them, NBS can be effective in improving mental well-being for a wider population beyond psychiatry\npatients . Attention restoration theory  suggests that even seeing a picture of a nature view can restore attention , which has been extended to a belief that experiencing a virtual nature can also bring mental well-being . However, more powerful evidence supports that experiencing an actually natural setting will be more effective than a virtual counterpart . However, there is still a knowledge gap in our understanding about the comprehensive attributes of nature to improve mental health and well-being.\n\nUrban green and blue spaces can be taken as a NBS to help cope with perceived life stressors . The WHO  defines an urban green space as \"a necessary component for delivering healthy, sustainable, livable conditions.\" Green space accounts for a big amount of urban nature as an affordable, accessible, and equitable infrastructure that protects mental health . Multiple approaches  have been employed in studies on the association of exposure to green space with the health of users . When the focus of subjects was on their mental health, the approach for assessment was mostly limited to survey data  and a few with crossover trials . Significant discord exists among study designs and definitions, and scattered field investigations make it difficult to aggregate the evidence and identify mechanisms from causal findings .\n\nA larger ambiguity is formed due to the lack of green space measurements with insufficient data about subjective accessibility, vertical distance neglection, and equity among communities . Technically, the structure of a green space can modify one's perception through adjusting meteorological perceptions . A group of green spaces will also determine mental perceptions by varied levels in accessibility , equity , largeness , and biodiversity . These issues also exist in studies on the relationship between blue space and mental health . Individuals living near coastal communities reported generally healthier and happier self-states than those living inland . People can perceive biodiversity of marine lives , which, combined with coastal settings, together characterize coastal wetlands as an effective NBS to alleviate anxiety and depression . Most studies focused on adults , and more works are needed to design and plan green and blue infrastructures as NBSs for children and elders . To our knowledge, studies that synthesize all of the above issues to assess the NBS effects of experiences in blue and green spaces are highly scarce.\n\nThe main source of data used for assessing NBS effects of green and blue spaces was formed as self-reported scores on questionnaires . This methodology is not practical for accurate data collection in large-scale studies, where multiple factors of demographics, location variation, and spatial dimensions are all considered for collection. Expenditures of time and labor may at least partially limit the return of data in large spatiotemporal assessments, but inevitable human errors and lack of validation are two major limits of self-reported scores . Both SRT and ART together suggest that our perception of psychological well-being comes from emotional self-cognition . Our emotions occur in response to an event, either driven by objective or subjective incidents, which will be shown on our faces as facial expressions . With modern face-reading recognition and big-data analysis techniques, studies have revealed that posted facial expressions can be used as a practical instrument to assess NBS effects on emotional perception in green spaces at local , regional , and national geographical scales . The effect of green-space exposure on posted facial expressions showed spatial distributions along geographical gradients , which can be shaped by daytime dynamic , demographic variation , regional microclimate , and public arrangement of infrastructures . Up to now, synthesized approaches based on facial expression scores have rarely been assessed for emotional responses to an experience in blue space. Knowledge on mental well-being in green space and conventional detection using a questionnaire methodology in blue space will be interesting for assessing NBS to cope with negative moods in green and blue spaces.\n\nWetland forests in urban areas are important NBS infrastructures to counteract effects from not only climate change but also urban stressors . Urban wetland forests are a\ntypical type of natural stand with dual-landscape types of green and blue spaces. The spatial distribution of facial expressions reflects emotional responses of wetland visitors, which can be optimized as a NBS to improve emotions in a combined green- and blue-space landscape. In this study, we conducted a large geographical scale investigation on the facial expressions of visitors in  wetland forest parks in cities across  coastal regions in East China. Our objective was to assess the NBS effect through evoking positive emotions by experiencing green and blue spaces. We also aimed to compare effects of two types of natural spaces as references to optimize forested wetland landscapes with greater outcomes in mental well-being for policymakers, planners, and designers. We hypothesized that:  positive emotions expressed through smiles can be evoked by experiences in both green and blue spaces, which  suggests a geographical north-south gradient,  with driving forces from demographic and landscape factors.",
        "7": " .. \n\nIn this study, Sina Weibo  was chosen as the social network service  platform for data collection. Photos of wetland park visitors' faces were downloaded from microblogs, which needed to be labeled with specific locations. We focused on a total of  wetland forest parks  in cities across  coastal regions in East China . These wetland parks were chosen because they are all famous wetland scenic spots in their host cities, and all had combined landscape characteristics of green- and bluespace patches. Green spaces of these wetland parks were dominated by trees and woody plants, but not aquatic weeds or lawns. All these pieces of information were confirmed by online comments and posted experiences in local SNSs of China, including Sina Weibo, Mafengwo Traveling , Xiaohongshu Marks of Lives , and Zhihu Q\\&A .",
        "8": " ..  \n\nTo ensure facial recognition accuracy, we required that:  subjects in photos must have facial characteristics of typical East Asian race,  all facial organs  have to be clearly visible,  no facial organs are to be covered or subjected to a deep shadow,  faces cannot be made up using over-dose of digital editing, and finally,  each photo had to contain only one visitor's face. Both photos and selfies can be documented in our photo dataset. If a photo contains multiple faces, the photo needs to be cropped to leave only one face per photo. To avoid pseudo-replicated uses of photos from the same person, all photos with faces from the same person have been eliminated to leave only one. A total of  photos were collected from targeted wetland parks, with each park having - photos .",
        "9": " .. \n\nGender and age of visitors were visually evaluated by two undergraduates. One technician recognized and estimated demographic information for each subject in photos, which was visually checked again by another technician or corroborated by the poster's personal information displayed on their profile page. Female subjects numbered three times the number of male subjects . Ages of subjects were categorized into chronicle ranges as toddlers , adolescents , young adults , middle-aged adults , and senior adults , according to standards of relevant studies . Young aged people accounted for the greatest number of subjects, followed by toddlers, with seniors being the lowest .",
        "10": " .. \n\nWe focused on extremely positive and negative emotions that were presented on visitors' faces. Hence, happy and sad expressions were recognized and rated, respectively. We are aware that facial expressions can be rated as scores for eight basic microexpressions . According to Keltner and Ekman , all facial expressions can be generally classified as presentation of positive emotions or presentation of negative emotions. The other reason to choose these two facial expressions was that they passed validation with the highest matching accuracies among all types . FireFACE version . software  was used for facial analysis. This software has been successfully used to recognize micro-expressions on faces of urban forest experiencers, several times . It recognizes facial expressions as three types of emotions . In this study, we did not use neutral expressions. Photos were manually uploaded to the software, analyzed by clicking \"analyze\", and rated to obtain facial expression scores, which can be output as \".xlsx\" formatted files.",
        "11": " .. \n\nThe landscape structures were evaluated by metrics assessing horizontal and vertical components. Horizontal structure was evaluated by green-space area, blue-space area, whole park area, and area ratios of green and blue spaces to the whole area of parks. Vertical structure was evaluated by metrics of elevation and tree height in landscape patches occupied by vegetations. Horizontal and vertical structures' landscape metrics were evaluated using ArcGIS V.. Locations of all wetland parks were outlined on Landsat  OLI images   through human-computer interaction. Area metrics were evaluated by the average area of the outlined region that was given by the machine. Cloud cover was controlled to be lower than , and radiometric errors and geometric distortions were corrected according to Zhao et al. . Satellite images with coordinates at the same places were referred to for outlining in Baidu Map records . All layers of landscape patterns were projected to the same set of coordinates, including WGS--UTM-Zone-N, -N, and -N. Patchy area can be calculated as the area that was given in the property of the geometry in ArcGIS. Elevation was determined by the digital elevation model  in ASTER GDEM M data . The height of the tallest\nfeature in landscape patches that were occupied by vegetations was calculated using digital surface models  in the AWD DSM data map . Tree height was calculated by the difference between the DSM value and the DEM value. Spatial distributions of landscape metrics can be seen in Supplementary Material Figures S-S.",
        "12": " ..  \n\nHappy and sad scores directly reflect expressions of positive and negative emotions, respectively. Happy and sad scores were used to calculate the net change in emotions, namely the positive response index  . As a face is a mixture of multiple emotions, including both happy and sad expressions to varied extents, a PRI score can reveal the level to present expressions of net positive emotions without the involvement of negative affect. PRI score was used to detect net emotion expression when exposed to strong or weak stimuli.\n\nSAS V. was used for data analysis and statistics. Our data about facial expression scores failed to pass normal distribution, and therefore they were transformed to enable the statistical analysis using general linear models . Dependent variables were ranked to transform them so that they were distribution-free  when being used in analyses . This makes data flexible in different kinds of analyses for studies on data of facial expressions . Analysis of variance  was used to detect combined effects  of location variation  and demographic differences  on happy, sad, and PRI scores . When significant effects were indicted as the main or interactive sources of variances, raw data were averaged to compare their differences according to Duncan's test at the . level. Specifically,  in response to an interactive effect involving location variation would be presented as stratifications to compare differences among locations at each category of demographic attributes. Spearman correlation was conducted to detect relationships between expression scores and landscape metrics. Since a correlation analysis can be used to detect the relationship between records of a landscape metric and scores of a type of facial expression, associations were different among relationships. Multivariate linear regression  was used to detect combined contributions of several landscape metrics to facial expression scores. When significant estimates were indicated by the MLR model, spatial distributions of estimated metrics were mapped in the study area. Thereafter, the outcome of optimizing patterns of significantly responsive expressions can be mapped using regressed data. This will be the final result that guides outlets using NBS theory.",

        "19": " . \n\nThe photos we used in this study were posted by users to Sina Weibo, which is a SNS platform with an open visiting policy. We admit that most emotions in these photos were posted rather than spontaneously captured. One may suspect that posed emotions caused\nsignificant errors and do not reflect one's actual emotional life. However, it has been found that expressed emotions on social media have an association with users' emotional lives, unless individuals posted photos to seal the access due to privacy protection . All photos that we collected were taken from users in public spaces of nature where posters aimed to share their appearance in a green or blue space. No photo was taken from anywhere that required private access. It has also been revealed that posed emotions in public can be affected by perceived stimuli, such as weather  and landscape metrics . Users were conscious that they were photographed and that such photos were uploaded online and included the setting around them. However, users were not aware that their photos were used for an academic study. Hence, emotions with perceived stimuli were evaluated at unconsciousness when analyzed in a regional pool.\n\nWe can accept our first hypothesis because both green- and blue-space areas had positive relationships with PRI scores. This suggests that experiencing both green and blue spaces can evoke net positive emotions for visitors. Our  were derived from posted emotions as facial expressions, which may have errors in reflecting emotions between true perceptions and posted ones. However, all our photos were collected from the same platform, leaving the source of variation as only drivers of location, gender, and age. Posted photo scores can be used for evaluating emotions in different spaces. Our  concur with previous  found by the questionnaire methodology . It was surprising that the positive relationship between blue-space area and happy scores did not exist for green-space area and happy scores. These  suggest that people can perceive more positive emotions in larger green spaces, but this effect was not so strong, as expected in blue spaces. Blue-space area also contributed to the spatial distribution of happy scores as a strong promotor. Therefore, the largeness of a blue space is a parameter that can be planned for when landscaping to improve NBS. Our  agree with Dr. Matthew White's findings in a program researching the health and well-being benefits of natural experiences across  countries . These contributions made by Dr. White were further confirmed by an editorial that states that to touch the aquatic environment in coastal blue spaces is a driver to make people happy . Pasanen et al.  stated that spending time in aquatic environments has greater benefits in inducing positive mood and reducing negative mood and stress than green space does. Our  also highly concur with those of Pasanen et al. , where natural experiences without blue spaces showed no association between mental health and green space. Further explanations for why blue space has a stronger effect than green space require more research. The largeness of a natural space should have contained more specific metrics that can be effective, but received rare disclosures.\n\nWe did not expect that elevation would have a negative effect on the presentation of positive emotions either as a main driver or in a group of contributors. Elevation generated a negative effect on positive emotions but a positive effect for blue-space areas, but we did not find any relationship between elevation and blue or green space areas. High-altitude exposure can induce negative feelings about enduring extreme environments and exercise needs , which will impair mood and cognitive functions . The microclimates beside water are colder and more moist than surrounding places at a further distance . Both conditions will also elicit negative emotions . In China, scenic spots in a natural park are usually linked by stairs, and those in high altitudes would arrive by walking up the stairs instead of twisted lanes. Negative emotions may also be shown in the tiredness on visitors' faces when they just arrived at a place for taking photos.\n\nWe can partly accept our second hypothesis because spatial distribution of expressed positive emotions interacts with the age of visitors. Older visitors in ages ranging from middle to senior tended to show positive emotions along the latitudinal gradient. Temperature is the main driver for the expression of positive emotions along a latitudinal gradient . Southern parts of our study area were subtropical and tropical regions with a warmer local climate than northern parts. Elderly visitors' emotions were sensitive to the local warm temperature of wetland parks and showed a geographical response. Demographic age also\nhad an interactive effect with different locations of green spaces on smiles on visitors' faces in North China . Therein, seniors also showed more happy faces in southern regions.\n\nGender of visitors was another demographic factor that had a significant effect on facial expressions. Females showed more positive emotions than males in our study. These  concur with those found by Liu et al.  and Wei et al. , which both adapted facial expression data from SNS as well. In a northern city of Shenyang, Guan et al.  also reported more happy emotions for random female pedestrians, both in a forest and along a promenade. In contrast, female pedestrians were found to show more negative emotions in natural settings in Changchun  and Harbin . We do not have enough evidence to assert that females look more unhappy than males when they are unconscious of being photographed. At least, more females had happy faces than males in posed photos that were uploaded online.\n\nFinally, we cannot accept our third hypothesis because of null effects from the interaction between demographic and landscape factors. To result in significant responses of facial expressions, demographic age interacted with geographical distribution and two landscape metrics .\n\nOur study has some limits that can be improved by further studies. First, the use of photos from the SNS platform is limited because most emotions are consciously presented. This causes some similar types of errors, for human subjects, to the questionnaire methodology. This limits the further comparison between posted photo emotions in SNS and others with unconscious emotions. A better way may be to collect big data with more respondents to dilute individual errors. Second, there were some uncertainties in the identification of the gender and age of people in photos, which may cause errors. For example, the experience of an undergraduate towards the age of a middle-aged visitor may lead to identification of the visitor as a senior. The assistant confirmation by checking personal information also has limits because not all users of Sina Weibo post their private information. The agreement of identification from more people across different levels of life experiences would help with this. Third, the satellite imageries we used had some limits in their resolutions. Landsat  OLI images' resolution is  m , while DEM and DSM extracts' resolutions are  m . The average area of a park in our study was . square kilometers, which meant that a park can generally harbor  grids for area analysis and  grids for altitude and elevation analyses. This is acceptable in a study, such as ours, at a regional scale across  parks. Human-computer interaction will further promote accuracy by correcting radiometric errors and geometric distortions. However, images with higher resolutions will be needed if a higher accuracy is acquired. In some specific regions, high-resolution imageries will be the basic requirement for analyzing landscape metrics, which needs to be considered in future works.",
        "20": " . \n\nUsing online records of facial photos, we found spatial differences of positive emotions and a north-south gradient distribution of smiles on faces of middle-aged and senior visitors. According to multivariate linear regression, we confirmed that blue spaces can be taken as a NBS to promote positive emotions by experiencing wetland forests with a large area and at low elevation. Therefore, wetlands in the central parts around Zhejiang and Shanghai were recommended as sites that bring a high probability of happiness. When considering the net positive emotion of happiness minus sadness, it was suggested to visit wetland parks in western parts around Hubei and Jiangxi. Our study utilized green and blue spaces of wetland forests as NBSs. Further studies are suggested to continue the approach and layout of our study and extend the geographical range to other places in the world. Green space should not always lack a relationship with facial expressions, but more studies are needed to form confirmative s on using green and blue spaces as NBSs.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/./f/s, Figure S: Spatial distributions of blue-space areas in wetland parks.
