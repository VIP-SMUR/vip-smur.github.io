        "3": " \n\nObjective: To explore fly-in fly-out  mining workers' attitudes towards the leisure time they spend in mining camps, the recreational and social aspects of mining camp culture, the camps' communal and recreational infrastructure and activities, and implications for health. Design: In-depth semistructured interviews. Setting: Individual interviews at locations convenient for each participant. Participants: A total of seven participants, one female and six males. The age group varied within - years. Marital status varied across participants. Main outcome measures: A qualitative approach was used to interview participants, with responses thematically analysed. Findings highlight how the recreational infrastructure and activities at mining camps impact participants' enjoyment of the camps and their feelings of community and social inclusion. : Three main areas of need were identified in the interviews, as follows:  on-site facilities and activities;  the role of infrastructure in facilitating a sense of community; and  barriers to social interaction. : Recreational infrastructure and activities enhance the experience of FIFO workers at mining camps. The availability of quality recreational facilities helps promote social interaction, provides for greater social inclusion and improves the experience of mining camps for their temporary FIFO residents. The infrastructure also needs to allow for privacy and individual recreational activities, which participants identified as important emotional needs. Developing appropriate recreational infrastructure at mining camps would enhance social interactions among FIFO workers, improve their well-being and foster a sense of community. Introducing infrastructure to promote social and\n\n\nrecreational activities could also reduce alcohol-related social exclusion.\n\nKEY WORDS: built environment, FIFO, fly-in flyout, mining camp, rural Queensland, social sustainability.",

However in another study, the time apart was considered a positive factor, by way of time together becoming more valuable. \n\nFIFO workers spend intensive periods of time  living in mining camps before flying home for their days off. These mining camps provide the workers with accommodation and recreational and social facilities for use during their leisure time. As such, the physical surroundings, infrastructure and the design of the built environment are likely to have an impact on the daily lives of FIFO workers. Research suggests that the built environment contributes to its inhabitants' well-being and social interactions.  This public health challenge has significant implications for policy and health and wellness programs.  Health interventions that enhance physical activity and social interaction are recommended by the International City/County Managers Association  and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. \n\nHowever, the relationship between facilities in mining camps and FIFO workers and the role communal facilities play beyond their functional roles as places to eat or exercise has not been thoroughly explored. The purpose of this study is to provide a starting point for this enquiry through an initial investigation into the everyday experience of FIFO mining workers' interacting with on-site mining camp facilities and the extent to which facilities contribute to or detract from a sense of community within the camps.",

Approval was given by the Queensland University of Technology Human Ethics Committee and all participants gave informed consent prior to the commencement of the interviews. A summary of participants is presented in Table .",
        "8": " \n\nFace-to-face interviews were conducted in April and May  at locations convenient for each participant. Interview questions were aimed at eliciting information about how satisfied participants were with living in mining camps, how often they used on-site recreational facilities and infrastructure and if and how these facilities could be designed to better meet their needs. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed in full. The data were analysed using a thematic analysis process to identify categories, themes and patterns.",
        "10": " \n\nAlthough the design and layout of participants' camps varied, some recreational facilities existed at all camps,\nincluding gymnasiums, basketball courts, pubs and dining halls. The majority of FIFO employees said that they were generally satisfied with the existing facilities. Five participants said they used them more than once a week, mainly to engage in fitness, sport and other recreational activities, such as soccer, touch football and group fitness activities.\n'Well they have. . . fitness programs or after-work programs. . I participate in a few CrossFit activities and touch football and sports activities.' Participant \n\nAll participants described a culture of drinking at all of the camps. While this culture was accepted and participated in by the majority of the participants, it was not always described as a positive aspect of the mining camps.\n'For the most part the drinking culture  because they stay up really late,  really loud, and don't really care about other people'. Participant ",
        "11": " \n\nThe issue of limited spare time was mentioned by all the participants in relation to the accessibility and desirability of the existing facilities. Participants had long shifts and travel times to and from their work sites, which limited their time for recreation. These time constraints were not consistently viewed as negative, with two participants treating the camps as places to work and exercise rather than to socialise. Other participants preferred not to socialise after work because of fatigue.\n'If I was spending four or five waking hours while I was there after work, and I didn't have a big commute, then maybe you would look at a bit more social activities. . .' Participant \n'I don't like associating or socialising after work, I prefer to treat it as a base to really focus on recreational activities. .' Participant \n\nTwo participants described a noticeable segregation between skilled and unskilled workers at their camps, which served to shape the use of facilities. Participant  said that there was a tendency to 'sit with your own people' and not interact with other groups.\n'... at the end of the shift for the operational guys they'll come back and will catch up with their  to - mates . . . they'll have BBQs and go to the pub and that sort of stuff.' Participant \n\nThe management and up-keep of facilities emerged as being discussed in the context of the use and acceptance\nof the facilities at the camps. Facilities management extended from general maintenance matters through to the organisation of more structured social activities.\n'Oh  just a little one . It's got to be a proper one. It's not very clean and I wouldn't even call it a swimming pool.' Participant \n'I think if I was a CEO of the mining camp I would maybe organise more activities that involve the whole camp . . .' Participant \n'... maybe get together for some foods . . . have a ... Participant \n\nManagement in the form of rules governing communal infrastructure also shaped the use and attitudes toward shared facilities.\n'... at the mining camp we can't , they are really strict . . . they are more concerned with your safety . . . they just look after their backside pretty much . . . in case there is a fire'. Participant ",
        "12": " \n\nMost of the participants highlighted the importance of feeling a sense of community and the feeling of inclusion in a group. Five participants said that they experienced a sense of community to some degree, either through friendships with colleagues, or through organised and impromptu sporting and fitness activities. The role of infrastructure in facilitating social interaction and contributing to a sense of community was highlighted in participants' descriptions of existing and desired facilities and infrastructure as places for meeting, socialising and exercising.\n'It's pretty good actually, because there are a lot of young guys and a lot of other engineers, so we play soccer twice a week and touch footy once a week . . .' Participant \n'I reckon it does  . . . they try to provide facilities . . . basketball courts and stuff like that . . . and our group of people, we like to play basketball a lot, or table tennis . . .' Participant \n\nDespite this, the importance of communal infrastructure providing for personal time and individual activities was also emphasised.\n'... it would be good to have some kind of screening in there, plants or stuff. Just somewhere you can have your dinner in peace, sometimes you want to be less social'. Participant \n'It's a really long day, it's  min  to work . . . a  hour day, and then  min home. I just want to go to work, come home, and relax . . .' Participant ",
        "13": "\n\nThe on-site experiences of FIFO workers and their use of mining camp recreational facilities and infrastructure varied according to the availability and quality of facilities, management of the facilities and the workers' individual preferences and needs. These FIFO workers felt that the infrastructure that facilitated and supported formal and informal sporting and social activities had the potential to enhance their working experience. Providing quality infrastructure within mining camps and communities has been identified as a key motivator for improving workers' quality of life and health outcomes.  Our preliminary findings suggest that wellmaintained facilities along with proactive management may enable workers to maintain their existing lifestyles, facilitate socialising and promote their emotional and physical well-being as well as developing a sense of community.  Interventions that enhance physical activity and social interactions address health and wellness outcomes for workers and their communities.  Although most participants said that they did not have time to fully use all of their camps' recreational facilities and infrastructure, all participants placed a high value on these facilities. Contributing to worker health and well-being has been found to increase productivity and worker satisfaction,  thus bringing into focus the importance of available facilities and infrastructure provided by mining companies.\n\nRules, organisation and management of the camp facilities also emerged as being closely related to the use and acceptance of facilities. It may be possible that the combination of adequate communal facilities along with proactive management of these facilities in the form of organised social or sporting events may potentially bring about a greater sense of community. When participants took part in social and sporting activities, which were either promoted by camp management or initiated by workers, they described a positive impact on their daily lives, including an increased sense of community membership.  The positive intersection between facilities and management can provide a pathway to break down the social exclusion between the different groups of mining employees residing at the camp; between drinkers and non-drinkers and potentially limit negative outcomes from alcohol consumption identified by participants.

As a pilot study, the operators and managers of the facilities were not included as participants. However, the findings are a useful starting point for exploring the ways in which recreational facilities at mining camps might affect the daily routines, satisfaction and well-being of FIFO workers. Future research is needed to explore in greater detail the interactions among design, maintenance and accessibility of recreational facilities and sense of community for FIFO workers. Mining camp facilities and infrastructure need to be considered not only within the context of the daily lives of FIFO workers, but also within the management strategies used by the operators. Thus, further research may be extended to include camp managers and operators to better understand and unpack the relationships between FIFO workers, mining camp facilities and the management of these facilities."
