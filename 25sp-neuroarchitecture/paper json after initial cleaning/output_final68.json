        "3": " \n\nGreen space is considered as the lungs of the city. It has immense health benefits mainly for elderly people. Regular physical activity in green space considerably reduces health risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory problems, high blood pressure, paralysis, diabetes and other chronic diseases. Besides, it facilitates social interactions and promotes the sense of community among the citizens, which is very important for health and wellbeing of people, especially for elderly, because they predominantly suffer from the social isolation problem. The data on self-perceived health status have been obtained while surveying the green space users through survey schedule. About  of elderly sampled of those people who are reportedly affected by any of such diseases or a combination of multiple. Similarly, in Australia -\\% of diabetes problems was found among the elderly. UGS benefits must be universal and this can be done through the universalization of its accessibility. This paper answers the questions as, Whether or not the health risk of NCD make elderly people necessary for visiting and using the green space? Whether or not the visit and use of park consequences better preconception on NCD related physical and psychological health? What factors restrict and motivate them to visit the green space? What would be the appropriate planning approach for making it available for neighbourhood residents? The paper finally proposes a participatory, bottom-up planning model as a planning toolkit.",
        "4": " . \n\nIn the web of urbanization, people in highly urbanized areas tend to have more symptoms and a high risk of lifestyle related with noncommunicable diseases. Today's modern urban life has turned into a complex mode. Rapid unplanned urbanization changes urban life predominantly. The busy and technology dependent urban life has brought changes in people's lifestyle and the related behaviour which exposes people to the high risk of non-communicable diseases . Non-communicable diseases , mainly Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease, Cancers, raised Diabetes, Respiratory Diseases, raised Blood Pressure, leads to premature death. NCDs globally causes around  of all deaths . The increased burden of morbidity and mortality due to NCDs is much in the industrialized countries like India . NCDs are usually emerges due to the long exposure to an unhealthy lifestyle involving tobacco and alcohol usage, stress, anxiety, lack of physical activity, rapid unplanned urbanization-industrialization-commercialization, consumption of the high-fat products and extended office working hours (.,\n). Though the people of all age group are having risk factors of such diseases, the increased aging becomes more vulnerable . Health risk turns severe at the old age than all other lower age categories. A long exposure to the related lifestyle and environmental determinants and their accumulation across the long-life durations happens to reason the elder more vulnerable to the NCDs and makes them urgent to visit the UGS for physical exercise . Physically activeness, good health and social well-being are associated with UGS utilization. Regular physical activity significantly reduces the risk of NCDs. As per WHO , the elder people should do at least  min of moderate intensity of physical activity in every week to attain better health condition. Therefore, UGS has an immense health and well-being benefit for elder citizens  by providing an ecologically and environmentally suitable place for their related physical activities. A good health is the fundamental requirement of socio-psychological wellbeing of elderly. The elderly suffers several NCDs, therefore, they need more access, more use of green space and more being connected with nature. Their health risk could be reduced by getting them into the UGS as to closer to the nature and for performing\n\n\n:    a Corresponding author.\n    E-mail addresses: dr.allgeoresearch@gmail.com , rahamanmohidur@gmail.com , iqbalhossain@gmail.com .\nphysical activity. The entire processes of making a healthy and active life of elderly demand availability, proximity and the regular use of UGS.\n\nIn view of the immense health benefits WHO  suggests at least  of the city's total area under green space. But most of the Indian metropolitan cities including Kolkata fall below the requirement as of WHO suggested. Approximately  of public open space remains at present . Kolkata city has been worse than other cities of India, what caused environmentalists much worried on the sharp rate at which the open spaces are vanished. The lack of urban green spaces in Indian major cities puts a challenge to the urban policy makers for promising healthier city-living.\n\nHaving a long on the health benefits of UGS, question arises, Whether or not the health risk of NCD makes elderly people necessary for visiting and using the green space? Whether or not the visit and use of park consequences in a better pre-conception on NCD related physical and psychological health? What factors restrict and/or motivate them to visit the green space? What would be the appropriate planning approach for making it available for neighbourhood residents? The study is reasonable to base the inductive inferences on the evidence described in it from the field study. The paper, therefore, takes the objectives of, i) studying the people's age relation with the health risk of NCDs, ii) analysing the relation of residential distance with the access and use of park by the elder people, iii) studying the motivational reasons for access and use of park by the elder people, iv) analysing the health impact of urban green space on the elder urban-residents, and v) recommending a planning model for healthy living of the urban elderlies.\n\nUrban green space  provides multiple benefits through various mechanisms . UGS eventually connects man with nature. UGS is a green infrastructure that promote city's public health  and wellbeing of people. Moreover, it provides a wider range of services related to the ecosystem and health opportunities to the urban dwellers . A higher proportion of green space in an area was generally associated with better health population . Richardson  observed a health impact of green spaces in United Kingdom and opined that the mortality rate decreases with increasing green space. The greenery in the surroundings has been found to be protective against the adverse effects of mental health, cardiovascular problem and can control the mortality rates too . Ernstson  empirically observed a link of psychological wellbeing with the urban parks and green spaces. Greener view of UGS rejuvenates and enhances the residents' contemplation and provides a sense of peace and tranquillity . Other green infrastructures, like street-lined trees, trail greeneries and else reasonably reduce the mental stress of individuals more particularly the elderly who feels loneliness and, thus it promotes the physical health as well. Therefore, it can be proved in this aspect that 'more green space is associated with the less stress in deprived communities' . Nowadays most research outcome displays a positive association of how often people would visit or how long they stay in urban green spaces with the possibility of reducing mental stress  and mental fatigue . Coldwell and Evans  found in their study that the green space diminishes depression and anxiety level and consequently relieves stress, by improving people's quality of life .\n\nPhysical health benefits of green spaces come through the mechanism of regular physical activities  in any form in UGS. According to WHO , the physical inactivity increases the health risk of chronic diseases. Richardson  and .  observed in their research that regular physical activity improves health by reducing the risk of NCDs, that is, High Blood Pressure, Obesity, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Cholesterol, Depression, Anxiety, Arthritis, Neurological syndrome, Osteoporosis and chronic back ache and so on. Regular physical exercise, walking or cycling thus eventually strengthen the muscles which support our joints and reduces\nexcess body weight . Individual who performs some level of regular physical activities have a lower risk of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and mortality . ..  observed that the physical exercise significantly reduces the chance of High Blood Pressure and increases self-esteem in an individual. High-quality green space in the neighbourhood is associated with higher levels of physical activity and, therefore, it improves self-assessed health . So, the green space  being an environmentally and ecologically potential, safe, secure and protected unit, is a best place for performing physical activity and therefore, becoming an essential place for maintaining physical and psychological health of urban dweller mainly for the elderly of a city. The retired people who are elder too, may have more time, but being an elder, they have lower physical activities due to some independent predictors, like increasing age, poor general health, low exercise self-efficacy  and also due to the factor of larger distance of park from their residence.\n\nAging is an inevitable biological phenomenon. .  observed that an incidence of age-related health ailment, such as Cardiovascular Diseases, Cancer, Arthritis, Osteoporosis, Diabetes, Neurodegenerative Diseases and others increase rapidly with aging. The prevalence of such diseases is more among the higher age people as compared to the young age people . In the United States, about  of adults over  years of age have at least one chronic disease and  have at least two chronic diseases . In Australia,  of diabetes problems was found among the elderly . .  found  of death toll of elderly  would happen due to the cardiac problems in the United States of America. In Australia, in an examination, it reveals that out of  risk factors associated with High Blood Pressure was found to be about  being responsible for the burden of disease in the  year or more aged people . .  observed that the hypertension as a highly prevalent disease among the elderly. Jaul and Barron  argued that the health risk of people with Osteoarthritis, Diabetes and mobility disability increases with age. .  found high risk of obesity and the symptoms of raised blood pressure among the elder women than men in urban Indonesia. A report of Australian Women's Health Network  reported the same findings of higher prevalence of arthritis among the Australian women in . Patra and Bhise , Bonita and Beaglehole  .  in their study found women are more vulnerable to the risk of NCDs as compared to the men. Division of labour, differential exposure and vulnerability to stress are major stressors of poor health of elder women . .  found a positive relationship between the amount of green space and self-reported health of senior adults. .  explored the role of green spaces in sleep deficiency and found a stronger protective effect for elderly as compared to young people. .  observed the social benefits of green space. Kim and Kaplan  contented that UGS facilitates the social interactions and promotes a sense of community among the citizens, resulting which, it enhances the quality of life through perceived social cohesion. . , the elder adults living in the inner-city neighbourhoods also get benefit from the presence and use of green spaces, which promote social ties and a sense of community. .  strongly argued that a social interaction is known to be very important for health and wellbeing, especially for the elderly, where social isolation has been significantly associated with increased mortality. Despite having immense health and social benefits of green space for elderly, .  contented some independent predictors like increasing age, poor general health, low exercise self-efficacy which lowers the physical activity.\n\nFew instances of research evidence are available on the urban green space study in Indian context. The scholars have studied UGSs of India in diverse context. Some scholars  studied urban green space in environmental and ecological perspectives. Singh  and   focused on the per capita and per land unit availability of urban green spaces. Bhaskar  and Imam and Banerjee  examined the\nurbanization impact on the green space change in selected Indian cities. .  detected the change of green space share in city's land uses over time through different satellite image analyses. None of the available literature deals with the urban green space in health\nbenefit perspective in Indian context. Therefore, the present research is an attempt to fill the knowledge gap.",
        "5": " . Materials and \n\nMany literatures have been reviewed for giving a theoretical foundation of this piece of research. A major part of the work is based on the primary data which is supplemented with secondary data. Primary data have been collected through a direct interaction with the green space users in the year . A total of  green space users  were interviewed at  selected green spaces  in Kolkata city . Kolkata Municipal Corporation , being a seventh largest as well as one of the old cities in India, is a glaring example of highly urbanized society with population density of , persons per sq. km. . The city houses . million residents, while the urban agglomeration accommodates approximately . million people having marked as a third most populous metropolitan unit in India. KMC houses about .\\% elder people  which is higher than any Metropolitan City of India . The substantial urban pollution, traffic congestion, poverty, overpopulation, high level of urban densification and a rapid decline of greeneries as well as blue spaces diminishes the physical and psychological health of elder citizens.\n\nA total of  parks were selected from  different municipal wards of KMC, on the multi-staged random sampling process. At the first stage, all  parks of entire KMC were identified in the 'field survey with GPS' for mapping their geospatial location and measuring their spatial dimensions. At the second stage, three primary criteria were used in sequence as, 'public park', 'common users' access' and 'park under use of running, walking and jogging' for preliminary selection of parks from all  parks of KMC. This  a preliminary selection of  parks. As a one-third of them a total of  parks have been selected for the field survey. Notably the selection assures that only one park was selected from one municipal ward. Finally,  parks were selected and identified from  municipal wards which were selected at the third stage, on the basis of secondary criteria as, 'population density of municipal ward', 'ward of old built-up', 'ward of new built-up', 'share of slum population' and 'size of park'. Such criteria were adopted for getting large number of respondents from diverse demographic and socio-cultural . In case of more than one park in a selected ward, the largest one has been selected for survey. Purposively,  wards of KMC were classified into five population density groups as, very high, high, medium, low and very low . The 'low' and 'very low' population density groups does not accommodate any of the preliminarily selected  parks, therefore none of the parks were sampled from these density groups. Only one  ward was found from each of 'very high' and 'high' population density group and seven wards from 'medium' population density group which   parks were sampled from  wards on population density criteria. Two  wards have been selected on the basis of history of built-up of wards  with one as 'old built-up' and another as 'new built-up' ward, therefore  parks were sampled. One  park was selected from a ward of larger slum share and another one  park was selected as a largest size. Therefore, finally selected  parks are out of the aforesaid preliminarily selected  parks and they are located in  different municipal wards . Following table briefs the selection procedure of sampled parks.\na. Selected parks on the basis of population density\n\n\n\nb. Selected parks on the basis of history of wards' built-up\n\n\nc.

The willing park users were interviewed. Five surveyors surveyed each park taking one park in one day at morning time from : am to : am when most of the people visit the park for physical activities. Therefore, a total number of respondents from all  parks finally counts  persons. Responses were recorded in the survey schedule. Indeed, the analysis and description in the paper are based on the self-reported and self-perceived information as furnished by the park-user respondents. Respondents self-reported the type of NCD as diagnosed by their consultant doctor and they are under treatment of it. The responses were captured on the self-perceived health status, purpose and frequency of park visit, as well as their demographic issues. Respondents in the park were asked to name the NCD  as diagnosed by the medical consultant doctor and to report their demographic issues like age, sex and occupation. For studying the necessity and outcome of the park visit, the responses of elderly were captured on frequency of park visit, residential distance of park, means of reaching the park and duration of the stay in the park. Further a selfrealization and self-perception on the level of improved physical as well as psychological health of the elderly park-users was captured on Likert scale to rate whether they feel an excellent, very good, good or moderate level of improvement or they feel not at all an improvement. Lastly question was asked to rate the preferred problems on Likert scale, as the elderly park-users face in the park.\n\nA household-level community survey has been conducted at randomly selected  households in  municipality wards which are\nPresent situation of health condition and use of green space.\n\n\nSource: Field survey in dwelling community.\npresented in above table. An understanding of the spread of NCDeflected people in community residence and their use of urban green space by age and sex are only objectives of this survey . Therefore, self-reported information on age, sex, whether or not NCD-effected, and whether or not use park for physical activity on regular basis, have been captured in - households in each of  selected wards of KMC.\n\nThe information has been presented in percentage figures. Chisquare analysis  has been done for the analysis of frequency  data at the level of significance -value  for supporting the arguments. Self-realization and self-perception on the level of improved physical as well as psychological health was captured on -point Likert scale with Likert responses like excellent, very good, good, moderate and improved not at all. Further data on Likert scale have been measured as an average score of -point Likert value for the study of plausible motivational reasons of park visit. Respondents were asked to assign the value out of  on their perception to the plausible motivational reasons and an average score of each response has been estimated. Responses on the Likert scale\nhas been captured to observe the best to worst preferred choices of the elderly park-users.",
        "7": " .. Health risk and age relation\n\nA field study of urban dwellers at sampled urban green spaces as well as at household-level community residence reveals a comprehensive understanding of people's age relations with related diseases. As stated in the methodology that a total of  households comprising  persons have been surveyed wherein male shares  female  . Out of them,  are found to be elderly with age  years. In the surveyed households it is observed that  of the elder people are reportedly affected by one or more non-communicable diseases  and out of them only  uses park for physical activity and rest  do not use. Whereas  of NCD-effected persons of age between  and  years uses UGS. This survey makes a clear observation that the elder persons are more among the NCD-\n\nAppearance of different diseases by gender and age group of people.\n\n\nSource: Field Survey in parks; Note: Figures in bracket are the total number of respondents surveyed.\nFrequency of visiting the green space and its purpose.\n\n\nSource: Field Survey in parks; Note: Figures in bracket is the total number of respondents surveyed.\neffected than all other lower ages, contrastingly their share in use of UGS is lower than all other lower ages. As far as the respondents of the park survey is concerned, a total of  park-users comprises  males  and  females  which divulges lesser access of females into the UGS . As largest  no.  of park-users are elder people with age  years,   are  years age,  are  years age and only  are of age less than  years . It is noteworthy that, whoever the elderly of community residence visit park shares more than all other age group as observed in the field survey in sampled parks. The survey reveals that the health risk of NCDs found to be higher among the retired persons, employed persons with overloaded-work and also among the housewives. This narrative is indirectly supported by the occupational grouping of elderly with NCDs  wherein out of  elder persons,  are self-employed ,  are retired persons and  are housewives .\n\nIn the study it is observed that  of green space users  are free of related diseases, who are mainly lower age and uses park to maintain their health . They mainly visit green space for enjoying the nature and breathing the fresh air. The study reveals that the people of higher age are at the higher risk of such diseases for which regular use of green space is an utmost. Obviously, higher age people are more vulnerable to such NCDs. In the study, it is observed that the NCDs generally starts appearing at the age between  and  years .\n\nThe field survey in the sampled parks reveals that out of  observed elder park-users  only  are not affected by any NCD,  by single NCD and rest  by multiple NCDs . Elderly suffers the multiple diseases which mostly leads a premature death as so far literature evidences. It comes to be true that most of the lower age people reported single disease whereas the elderly reported multiple diseases. This happens because people's aging increases the health risk-factors . Among the respondents, those are more than  years old are largely affected by multiple NCDs at a time.\n\nThe Chi-square  analysis for relationship between the type of diseases and age of the respondent is reasonable for policy implication. The  value estimated from a  contingent table  becomes . which is greater than the critical value of . and going to be significant at -value  for  degree of freedom . The outcome of the test favours a strong relationship between age and health risk of different NCDs. A tendency of prevalence of NCDs is expected to rise with increasing the age of people, therefore the use of green space come to be more essential for the people with such diseases. In the analysis of NSSO data, Patra and Bhise  observed an increasing prevalence of NCDs among the aging people in India, which supports the present research outcome. Another Chi-square test has been conducted to examine whether the variation in NCD-affected people at different age is due to by chance. The analysis has been conducted at  UGS users  of four age categories. The calculated Chi-square value has been estimated from a frequency\n\nUrban green space  visits of elderly and its self-reported physical and psychological health impact.\n\n\nSource: Field Survey in parks.\n\nIt is worthy to enlighten that the females are found to be more diabetic and obese than male people.

        "8": " .. Green space  visits and its use by elderly for healthy living\n\nPeople's age determines the wish of how frequently one can visit the UGS. Generally, elder people feel it a burden to get up at very early morning and to reach the park. It turns more burden if UGS is located at far distance from residence. Indeed, a frequent visit of UGS by elderly is undoubtedly a manifestation of the importance of green space on their health and well-being. In the field survey about  of park-users are found with age more than  years, of them  are daily users . The Chi-square distribution for relationship of age with frequency of UGS visit  is . which is much greater than the critical value . at  degrees of freedom, reveals a significant association with -value . The outcome infers that the frequency of UGS visit  and aging of population is significantly associated. Therefore, a more urge is found among the elderly city dwellers. An urge of better health is manifested in the increasing trend of its utilization among the elderly.\n\nResidential proximity is an important factor of users' access to the green space . Out of total  elderly park users,  comes from within  m  of residence,  from  to  m ,  from . to . km , while it suddenly declines to  and  for the residential distance of . and . km respectively . In nutshell, about  of elderly visits green space within  km from residence. The analysis makes a narrative that the higher distance reduces the number of elderly persons to visit and use it. Those are short distant access green space by walking , but long distant elderly depends on vehicles like personal car  and bike . Some are cycling  to visit the green space . The elderly who visits the green space stays for a variable time for performing physical exercise, talking with park mates, and taking rest with enjoying greeneries. For such purposes only  of elderly found to stay a daily average time less than  min , however  of them stays there  and  more than  min . Frequency of visiting the green space emerges out of the people's urge to deal a healthy life. About  of the elderly visit green space daily and most of them on the advice of their consultant doctors  and they\nall performs physical activity in many forms. The health risks as well as doctor's advice makes a fair reason as why a huge number of elderlies visit the park. This impact on the physical as well as psychological health and social bonding with mates in the park.",
        "9": " .. Motivational reasons and health impacts of urban green space on elderly\n\nNow it is important to understand the motivational reasons of the elderly to visit the urban green space . For this analysis, some plausible reasons were set in a Likert scale to measure the most motivating and guiding reasons of visit . The analysis reveals that improved health as a best reason that scores an average . out of the  point Likert scale. However other motivating reasons as they reported are also noticeable, like get fresh air , get peace, calm and quiet environment  and neighbourhood . The elderly also feels relaxation  while visit and stay in the green scape . To some, elderly residential proximity with average score . is an important motivational reason of regular visit of green space . Therefore, to be physically active is the dominant motivation of most of the green space users.\n\nThe field study reveals that the elderly city-dwellers are largely benefited of the green spaces for healthy living. The data analysis clearly manifests an urge of the aging NCD-affected people to visit the green spaces for physical activity. They affirmed to be feeling physically fit and healthy on regular physical activity in the UGS and this makes a reason of why they frequently visit the UGS. The respondents reported the levels of improved health due to regular physical exercise which was captured on -point Likert scale . About  of them self-perceived an 'excellent' level of improved physical health , whereas  and  have a self-perception of 'very good' and 'good' level respectively . Further  and  of elderly reportedly self-perceives an 'excellent' and 'very good' level of improved mood and attention  on the regular visit of park respectively .",
        "10": " .. Planning intervention for UGS benefits to elderly\n\nResidential proximity as well as unavailability of green space minimizes accessibility of elderly. This mainly poses serious difficulties for the elderly who rather urgently need it. WHO  recommends a linear distance of  m or five minutes walking distance as most desirable for green and healthy city as well as active living of residents. This problem is more severe in high density neighbourhood where planning intervention for UGS development and management is truly challenging. In the survey it is observed that almost elderly visits park from within  km . of residence and a very few of them visits from more than  km . This is an important issue of planning the green space for citizens' health benefit. Residential larger distance is a discouraging factor for elderly who need much but cannot access therefore remains deprived of health and well-being benefits of the UGS. From the field survey and interaction with respondents it comes to be true that the higher distance resists their frequency of visiting and they might not be able to access farthest elsewhere. The argument favouring the proximity of UGS for universal accessibility is reasonable for healthy living of common and quality of life, but it seeks planning intervention to open up opportunities for physical activity and greenery view at the neighbourhood proximity. Planning emphases need to be given for making availability of green space at possible closer distance to the community residences so that elderly can access and use it at maximum.\n\nBesides residential proximity problem, elderly park users have reported some more problems as they face in the use of park. Such problems have been analysed on the -point Likert scale and their score tells us a range of most serious to less serious problems  which need a planning intervention. Poor maintenance of park is most common and most serious problem with an average score . , followed by safety fear",
        "12": " Proposed Pattern of Bottom-Up Planning Approach\n\n\nSource: Designed by authors.\n, long distance of park from residence , poor facility in the park  and dog mess  . Such are mainly related to the park maintenance and management problems which reflects a poor attention of the local government towards the planning and management of the parks.\n\nIndeed, the education impact upon the motivation of an individual for health benefit of green spaces. Having an understanding people intend to participate in the health benefit mechanism of the green spaces. Therefore, it is one of the guiding factors of UGS accessibility. Almost UGS users are found to be educated. Patra and Bhise  found a higher prevalence of NCDs among the illiterate or low educated women as compared to similar level of education of men in India. Therefore, the efforts must be to bring all aging community residents who are out of the green space opportunities. The efforts of urban planning and policy formulation may make sure the healthy living of all aging people of the city. Getting them into the health benefit mechanism of UGS is a major challenge and this can be possible through the community participation toolkit in planning intervention. The city managers must be committed to assure the provisions of green space availability and accessibility for health and wellbeing of the elderly city dwellers and it must be linked with the city and town planning activities.",
        "13": " . Recommendation of participatory bottom-up planning model\n\nThis section deals with a challenge of how to make a pathway for reducing the health risk of elderly with NCDs through establishing the green space opportunities in neighbourhood community. While all municipal wards of KMC have been classified into the population density areas, only one park in each very high- and high-density wards were observed . It proves a lack of green space opportunity therefore the opportunity for elderly to be physically active in dense areas of the city. Some scholars across the\nglobe proposed planning ideas and guidelines as per the suitability, and nature of problem of the local area..  opined that at the local municipality level, within the spatial planning setting green space toned to compete with other land uses and developed Green Credit Tool  for Amersfoort Municipality of Netherlands.  .  proposed a planning tool known as 'Urban Meteoropathy' phenomenon for high density city - as in Macau Peninsula, wherein they suggested multiple layers of greening for ground, wall and rooftop of buildings for solving the problem of lack of green spaces. But they did not focus the green space opportunity for physical activity of elderly. Based on the landscape ecological approach Haaland and van den Bosch  recommended in strategic planning for compact city environment as, preserving green spaces, improving green space quality, development of green space on redeveloped sites and greening streets. Effective policy formulation and its implementation is reasonable for citizens' right to the city and right to their healthy living. WHO Europe  recommended a long-term perspective planning with stakeholders' collaboration for promoting urban dwellers' health and wellbeing.\n\nThe planning efforts for promising urban green opportunities and participation of elderly in the physical activity in KMC, must focus the issues like quantity as well as quality of parks to attract people, parks at closer distance to the community dwellers, public awareness for their participation and incorporation of green space planning in the city's infrastructure development planning  need to be focused.\n\nIndia being a developing country emphasizes more on the centralized planning or top-down planning approach . Local urban governance in collaboration with central government planning authority may plan for urban green space infrastructure for healthy city living. In line of Edwards and Tsouros  that the planning to increase physical activity can make a difference in health and well-being\n\nSource: Model designed by authors.\nof elder urban people. Keeping all issues in mind the local planning authority i.e., KMC may adopt a 'bottom-up' planning approach in policy formulation, with the engagement of community dwellers . .  also proposed a similar model of green space planning namely Conneswater Community Greenways intervention in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe proposed planning model  for the present study area KMC simplifies the planning process of how to begin it from a grass-root level and how to integrate the urban green space components with the city/ town planning. In this model, at the first step problems, resource availability, opportunities and constrains are to be identified at the local level then the local people to be involved in planning practice. Fund allocation is to be confirmed by the local government and higher-level government. Maximum possible proximity of UGS from the residence toned to be maintained while planning and design the green space.\n\nAt the stage of improvement of improvement of green space, the provision of publicly accessible UGS at residential proximity would be praise worth for elderly. Besides, the infrastructure facilities inside the UGS, e.g., exercise aids, exercise superintend, first aid, toilet, drinking water, resting place, safety and security measures and others will enhance the accessibility of elderly. Neighbourhood individuals will get involved in the community participation programme for regular UGS\nmaintenance and they must be groomed with the sense of belongingness. Separate walking and cycling track in UGS may enlarge the opportunity for physical activity. In the high-density neighbourhood areas where open public space for UGS development is rarely available the local government can make trails and streets with greeneries, which can open a place for running and walking of elderly at closer location. At the plan execution stage, the local government can associate the government and non-government organizations, banking sector and private entrepreneurs to source the fund for development and re-development as well as management of public green spaces for active and healthy life of city dwellers.",
        "14": " . \n\nQuantity and quality of UGS are important for multiple benefits including health and wellbeing. This paper is essentially designed to focus on how elderly require most the UGS and how to get them into it at maximum possible level. At the success of planning intervention, the urban habitat would be sustainable, greenery and healthier. Elderly, more specifically elder-female housewives are at the high risk of NCDs like, High Blood Pressure, Obesity, Diabetes, Cholesterol, Cardiac, Depression, Anxiety and else. Such diseases are associated with physical\ninactivity. The crux of the aforesaid narratives may guide planners and policy makers for the purpose. Therefore, green spaces are not only for the beautification and decoration of the city, simultaneously it has immense health and well-being importance.\n\nThe mechanism of becoming physically active is the physical activity in any form as recommended by WHO. The venue, which is desirably with greenery, safe and secure for physical activity is required at proximity of neighbourhood. This emanates an immediate need of inclusive planning intervention for the city and the plan must be with an objective of how to get the universal people into the UGS, because UGS benefits must be universal. The city/town planner at the local municipal government level may follow the recommended 'participatory bottom-up' planning model for healthy city living. The plan has a merit of having a feature of community participation with the local government efforts in planning the urban green space and engagement of elderly in physical activity."
