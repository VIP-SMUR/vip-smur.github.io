Shorter distances to the city center, higher densities, and mixed land uses are found to positively contribute to overall social well-being.

        "4": " . \n\nEmpirical studies examining relationships between the built environment and social well-being have been focusing on neighborhood social capital , neighborhood sense of community , and neighbor ties . This paper, rather than focusing on neighborhood social interactions, investigates the impact of the built environment on overall social well-being. For this purpose, the study focuses on personal relationships; an individual's relationships with friends, romantic partners, and relatives. Empirical research examining how the built environment affects an individual's overall social life and eventually personal relationships is scarce. And since strong personal relationships are considered to be one of, if not the single most important life domain in subjective well-being , it is crucial to understand if and how they are influenced by the built environment and by prevalent urban forms such as the compact city and low-density suburbs .\n\nThis paper aims to develop and test models that empirically investigate if, and how, the urban form affects personal relationships. The paper answers two main research questions:  How does the compact city affect personal relationships?  How do urban form\ncharacteristics affect personal relationships? The case for this research is the metropolitan area of Oslo. This study explores its research questions by employing structural equation modeling  combined with qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews and direct comparisons of survey respondents' evaluations of the impact of neighborhood on social life. SEM allows the inclusion of mediating variables between the two main elements of interest, in this case the urban form and personal relationships. These mediating variables, along with the analysis of interviews with residents of Oslo, help explain causal relationships and provide further support for causality.",
        "6": " .. The compact city and personal relationships\n\nThe compact city may have well-established benefits for environmental sustainability , but its social impact is a subject of academic debate . Early urban sociologists expressed their fears over the impact of large and dense cities on human relationships. Simmel  observed that cities create impersonal social interactions since residents strive to adapt to the intense rhythms of urban life. He argued that big-city residents encounter numerous people in their every-day lives compared with residents of small towns or rural areas, and since they cannot engage with everyone, they eventually become emotionally detached. Similarly, Wirth  noted that urbanism generates impersonal and superficial relationships between residents. Indeed empirical research suggests that social relationships at a neighborhood level are weaker in high-density urban forms . High-rise buildings are also found to generate impersonal relationships between neighbors .\n\nOn the other hand, Glass  observed that lower densities increase physical distance which can lead to greater social distance and eventually higher social isolation and loneliness. Later on, Jacobs  argued that a high concentration of people is necessary for all functions of a city. She also underlined the importance of sidewalk life for social contact and as she explains, sidewalk life is not possible in low-density suburbia. In addition to high densities, as both Jacobs  and Alexander  point out, neighborhoods with mixed functions are also key to increase social interaction. Mixed functions enable the movement of people locally for various reasons, increasing the use of local public spaces such as sidewalks and parks and offering opportunities for people to meet and interact. Putnam  argues that sprawled development, typically found in suburbs, contributes to lower levels of social interaction. The reasoning is that as suburban dwellers travel longer distances to approach workplaces and facilities, they have less time for involvement in groups for leisure activities. In that regard, Mitrany's  empirical study suggests that one of the advantages of high-density urban forms is that they offer increased opportunities for socializing. A study by Balducci and Checchi  demonstrates that friends and neighbors may play a catalytic role in subjective well-being, and suggests that this relationship is affected by the accessibility to shops and meeting places as well as local opportunities for meeting people and for volunteering. Accessibility to so called \"third places\" , which is higher in compact areas , has been suggested to have a positive impact on quality of life . Likewise, this is supported by Leyden, Goldberg, and Michelbach  finding that local facilities have a positive impact on quality of life in cities. Leyden and coauthors attribute the importance of local facilities for quality of life to increased opportunities for social activities and gatherings.\n\nTalen and Koschinsky  conducted a literature review of the impact of compact neighborhoods on neighborhood social relationships observing that most empirical findings suggest that this impact is positive and significant. However, most studies examined in the review, and most existing studies in general, focus on cases relevant to New Urbanism rather than typical high-density urban cases. The cases examined are, in other words, walkable and mixed land use suburbs or small towns which are compared with typical sprawled suburbs. Limited relevant research exists on high-density neighborhoods found in cities.\n\nWhat is even more important though is that most relevant empirical studies still focus on neighborhood social interactions rather that switching focus to overall social well-being. The importance of local social relationships is declining . As Dunkelman  explains, in the past people paid more attention to neighbor ties since they did not have other alternatives, but nowadays they have the opportunity to spend time with those they love the most. This can be achieved either through face-to-face contact enabled by the increase of mobility or from distance via the rise of technology. Furthermore, since education levels and levels of specialization increase, social relationships are not built primarily based on residential proximity but rather based on common interests . Therefore, empowered by high mobility and technology, people can develop and maintain friendships and romantic relationships with those they share common interests with, independently of whether they live in the same neighborhood. Taking all these aspects into consideration, it seems necessary\nthat urban researchers do not only investigate neighborhood social life, which is of course still important, but pay greater attention to the impact of the built environment on all relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners.\n\nTo sum up, it seems that compact urban forms - characterized by high density, high accessibility, public transport, and mixed land uses  may create more opportunities for socializing; whereas, suburban forms may foster closer social ties at the neighborhood level. These two aspects, opportunities for socializing and neighbor ties, are, however, just some of the components of overall social well-being. There is still little evidence on how urban form affects overall social well-being. This issue could be assessed by investigating satisfaction with personal relationships, which is a more inclusive measure - since it encompasses relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners - and thus a stronger predictor of happiness .",
        "7": " .. Predictors of personal relationships\n\nMarriage or intimate relationships and relationships with family and friends, defined as personal relationships, are important predictors of subjective well-being . The happiest people tend to have stronger personal relationships . On the other hand, loneliness is increasing , posing threats to physical and mental health  and affecting mortality similarly to other well-established risk factors . But what are the predictors of strong, satisfying personal relationships?\n\nMarital status, number of close relationships, frequency of meeting friends and relatives, support received from close relationships, and opportunities for social contact are all relevant indicators . Empirical evidence shows that marriage and romantic relationships have an important impact on subjective well-being . Furthermore, people who have many friends are found to have higher levels of subjective well-being than those who have few friends, and people who see friends more often are happier than those who spend more time alone . Those with more friends are also found to have less mental distress . In addition to socializing with friends, spending time with family members is also positively associated with subjective well-being . Positive relationships with both friends and family are suggested to have a positive impact on health . Improving social support - which depends on both the number of relationships as well as the frequency of socializing  - and enhancing opportunities for social contact have both been suggested as measures to address loneliness and its associated risks .\n\nConceptual models explaining the influence of urban form on personal relationships satisfaction have not been developed and examined adequately in previous empirical research. This study aims to develop and empirically examine such models. The number of close relationships, frequency of socializing, social support, and opportunities to meet new people are all aspects relevant to personal relationships that play a role in subjective well-being. Since personal relationships satisfaction is a strong predictor of subjective well-being and these aspects are all relevant to personal relationships, this study will examine these aspects as intermediate variables between urban form and personal relationships satisfaction. In other words, they will be examined as predictors of personal relationships satisfaction that could be influenced by the urban form. Living with a spouse or partner will also be examined as a control variable as it may influence some of these intermediate variables as well as personal relationships satisfaction.",
        "9": " .. Study area\n\nThe study area for this paper is the metropolitan area of Oslo. The inner city of Oslo contains predominantly compact neighborhoods characterized by high density, public transport, and mixed land uses, while the inner and outer suburban neighborhoods are mostly characterized by single-family housing, car reliance, and separate land uses. This contrast in Oslo's urban structure is highlighted by research on residents' traveling distances and transport modal split . The strong presence of both typical compact and typical low-density suburban neighborhoods allows us to examine the possible influence of urban form on personal relationships within a diverse range of neighborhood attributes.",
        "10": " .. Data sources\n\nThis study uses data collected through a questionnaire survey and  qualitative in-depth interviews, both conducted in May-June . Participants in both the survey and the interviews were residents of the metropolitan area of Oslo. The survey covered  neighborhoods in total, within various central and suburban locations . Selected residents were invited to participate by letter with a link to an online questionnaire. The choice of neighborhoods as well as the number of letters sent to each neighborhood was made aiming to generate a socioeconomically representative sample that includes large numbers of both compact-city and low-density suburban residents. Thus, the study aims to achieve high representativeness in diverse urban forms, and not necessarily a highly representative sample within each of the  neighborhoods. The questions of the survey were addressed at the individual level and only one person per household received a letter. Participants were  years or older, but apart from this they were randomly selected within each case neighborhood. The survey did not include any incentives or reminder letter. The questionnaire was pilot-\ntested firstly and then revised accordingly. The number of valid responses was  and the response rate was . Survey respondents were asked whether they would also be willing to participate in a personal interview. Based on this,  interviewees were selected,  from compact and  from low-density suburban areas.\n\nThe sample's sociodemographic characteristics do not deviate much from the population, but there are some differences . Survey participants are on average slightly older and slightly more highly educated than the population. Immigrant populations are underrepresented in the survey as their response rate is lower. Altogether, these aspects contribute to relatively higher incomes among the respondents than among the population. Moreover, couples are overrepresented in the survey. Nevertheless, because relevant variables are controlled for in SEM analysis, these biases are not expected to significantly affect  in the present study.",
        "11": " .. Variable descriptions\n\n\nThe study employs two approaches to examine the impact of the urban form on personal relationships. The first approach uses an exogenous dichotomous variable \"compact neighborhood\" where  is lowdensity suburban neighborhood and  is compact neighborhood. This\n\nDescriptive statistics of all variables.\n\n\n A t-test of difference in mean shows significant differences between compact and low-density suburban at .\n Household income divided by the square root of household size.\n Median adjusted household income is  for compact and  for low-density suburban residents.\nvariable is used to evaluate the effect of compact-city principles on personal relationships and applies to analysis with participants solely from compact and low-density suburban neighborhoods. Sample from other types of urban forms is excluded when this variable is used. The categorization of a neighborhood into compact, low-density suburban, or other  is based on each respondent's residential address. A neighborhood is classified as compact when high population densities, apartment blocks, and mixed commercial and residential land uses are all present, and as low-density suburban when low population densities, detached housing, and separate land uses are all present. Mean population densities are  persons per hectare for compact neighborhoods and  persons per hectare for low-density suburban neighborhoods. Other types of neighborhoods that fall between these two categories, and are not included in the analysis for this approach, are neighborhoods with mixed types of housing or medium densities, or low-density neighborhoods within the inner city. All these neighborhoods have mostly separate land uses. Of course, the boundaries for such categorizations could be slightly different, but as tested in preliminary analysis the trends of the  would not materially change.\n\nThe second approach employed to examine the impact of the urban form on personal relationships investigates detailed urban form characteristics and draws sample from all types of neighborhoods. Three basic characteristics of the physical form are assessed: density, accessibility, and land use mix. Density is examined with neighborhood population density, measured by dividing the population of each area by the area coverage in hectares. Accessibility is examined with distance to city center, measured from the centroid of each neighborhood. Land use mix is examined with the number of cafés, restaurants, bars, and community centers within a radius of  m from the centroid of each neighborhood. For this variable, the logarithm is taken in the SEM analysis to ensure that the normal distribution assumption holds.\n\nSEM analysis also controls for the following sociodemographic variables: age, employment status, living with partner or spouse, household income, and gender. Household income has been adjusted\nfor household size with one of the most commonly used equivalence scales, the square-root transformation of household size . Other sociodemographic variables, such as citizenship, education level, household size, presence of children in household, and number of children in household were assessed in preliminary analysis but did not demonstrate any significant effect on personal relationships satisfaction.",
        "12": " .. Analysis approach\n\nTo investigate its research questions, this study employs SEM  along with qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews and direct comparisons of survey respondents' evaluations of the impact of neighborhood on social life. For SEM analysis, software AMOS  is used. SEM is the preferred main analytical approach in this study because the examined relationships are complex, consisting of mediating factors besides the main variables of interest. SEM calculates both direct and indirect effects as well as total effects  specified in the theoretical model. These capabilities of SEM allow testing theoretical models that attempt to explain causal mechanisms.\n\nStructural equation models comprise path analysis and potentially latent variables. For the purposes of this study, only path analysis is employed. Maximum likelihood estimation is used along with bootstrap of  replications. Bootstrapping allows the calculation of approximate significance levels of total effects in SEM. Two structural equation models are developed and path analysis is conducted for each of them. Model  examines the effect of compactness on personal relationships and on several mediating factors between the two. This model uses sample only from compact and low-density suburban neighborhoods . Model  is more detailed and examines the influence of detailed urban form measures on personal relationships and on mediating factors. This model uses sample from all neighborhoods . Sample sizes are reduced due to excluding cases with missing values, as required by bootstrapping. , nevertheless,\n\nNotes: * , *** .

Control variables and error terms are not shown in the model diagrams to reduce complexity and present parsimonious diagrams.",
        "14": " .. Compactness and personal relationships\n\n\n\nAfter controlling for sociodemographics, compactness has positive and significant standardized total effects on the number of close relationships, on the frequency of meeting friends and relatives, on support from close relationships, on opportunities to meet new people, and ultimately on satisfaction with personal relationships . In other words,  suggest that residents of compact neighborhoods are in general more satisfied with their personal relationships as they have larger networks of close relationships, meet friends and relatives more regularly, receive stronger social support, and have more opportunities to meet new people compared with residents of low-density suburban neighborhoods. The standardized total effect of compactness on personal relationships satisfaction  is significant both statistically and practically since personal relationships are affected by a variety of factors.\n\nSociodemographic variables also contribute to personal relationships satisfaction . Age is negatively associated with the number of close relationships, the frequency of meeting friends and relatives, and support from close relationships. Nonetheless, it is positively associated with personal relationships satisfaction. This may\nseem paradoxical but is explained by the fact that although the evaluation of determinants of personal relationships may decrease with age, personal expectations may also decrease. Therefore, an older person might be less demanding when evaluating satisfaction with personal relationships. As expected, unemployment is found to negatively contribute to personal relationships satisfaction and all relevant determinants, since it not only negatively affects income but also social interactions and psychological well-being . On the other hand, as expected, living with a partner or spouse positively affects personal relationships satisfaction as well as social support. It is, nevertheless, negatively associated with the frequency of meeting friends and family. This is reasonable and consistent with relevant research  as having an intimate relationship may decrease the needs for socializing with others. Females are found to be more satisfied with their personal relationships than males since they have a larger number of close relationships, meet friends and relatives more frequently, and receive stronger social support. Income is also found to have a positive association with personal relationships satisfaction and most relevant determinants.",
        "15": " .. Urban form measures and personal relationships\n\n\n\nAn additional analysis conducted for different groups suggests that the positive effect of shorter distances to city center on number of close relationships, frequency of socializing, and social support is slightly stronger for households without children compared with households with children.

Since it is not easy for parents with young children to travel to other areas for leisure , they may evaluate long distances to places where they can meet new people more negatively than nonparents do. And nonparents, who in general tend to socialize at a larger geographical scale, are more negatively influenced by long distances regarding the frequency of social gatherings or the number of friends compared with parents, who in any case tend to socialize locally.\n\nIt should be mentioned that distance to city center and density are\nclosely related since higher densities reduce distances, and the city center and the areas around it are mostly dense, thus offering accessibility benefits. As  in Table  indicate, a low or medium density neighborhood in the inner city  yields similar personal relationships satisfaction as a high-density inner-city  neighborhood because of similar distance to city center, but the high-density neighborhood may offer more opportunities to meet new people and may enable more frequent socializing. Neighborhood density may not play a direct role in personal relationships satisfaction, but it plays an indirect role by contributing to overall density which can significantly increase or decrease distances and accessibility.

        "16": " .. Impact of distance to city center on social life\n\nTo compound stronger support for claims of causality, this study also examines the impact of the distance to the city center on social life by directly questioning survey participants. In particular, they were asked to evaluate how their neighborhood influences their social life on a scale of   to  . To achieve greater consistency, survey participants were asked to identify their neighborhood as the local area within  min walking distance from their residence. Social life, although closely related, should not be interpreted as satisfaction with personal relationships. This question is more relevant to the endogenous variables on opportunities to meet new people, the number of close relationships, the frequency of meeting friends and relatives, all of which are however significant determinants of personal relationships satisfaction.  in Fig.  suggest that social life is positively influenced by shorter distances to the city center. This finding provides further support to the  of SEM which indicate that compact urban forms may increase opportunities to meet new people and enable residents to maintain more close relationships and to socialize more often with friends and relatives.",
        "17": " .. Qualitative analysis\n\nAnalysis of in-depth qualitative interviews is important for this type of study since it can provide insights into causality and causal\n\nmechanisms . Particularly in this study, qualitative analysis can help further discern whether there exists a causal relationship between compactness and satisfaction with personal relationships and, in that case, why and how this relationship is shaped. As cities are complex and different from each other both structurally and culturally, qualitative material may additionally shed light on the context of social life in the specific case of the Oslo metropolitan area.\n\nThe first part of the analysis examines the value placed on personal relationships by both compact and low-density suburban residents. The interviewees were asked what is important to them when defining a good life. As expected, personal relationships emerge as a major contributor to quality of life. Six out of ten interviewees mentioned personal relationships and social life first when responding to this\nquestion. Three of these respondents live in compact and three live in low-density suburban areas. Their responses are as follows:\n\nFriends, social... Social life is very important. I think that is the most important of all.\n\n...it's more of a personal nature. You know... You know... Relationships and stuff like that.\n\nTo have good friends, to have a nice job. Good colleagues. To feel important. To feel that you are part of society and you can contribute and give something back.\n\nTime to spend with my friends and family. And...\n\nThe people are the most important things to me. Nice, interesting people around me.\n\nFriends, family...\n\nThe other four participants provided differing views. These responses not only confirm claims of how important personal relationships are for quality of life, but also suggest that they are similarly important to both residents of compact as well as low-density suburban areas.\n\nQuantitative  from SEM and direct questioning in the present study imply that compactness facilitates social life and personal relationships. This is further highlighted by several interviewees' responses such as:\n\nI hope I will have more time to do things after work . And that would be easier. But mostly I hope I can catch up with my friends more often.\n\nI'm more social there  than I was before  so I do like that, yeah.\n\nIt makes it easier to relations and stuff. More urban...\n\nAs with  from direct questioning in the previous section, all these qualitative findings, at least partially, contribute to dismissing possible claims that compactness is positively associated with satisfaction with personal relationships primarily due to neighborhood selfselection. In other words, it does not seem that people who place lower value on relationships choose to live in low-density suburbs, while socially inclined extroverts prefer compact areas. Indeed, as residents' responses suggest, it is the urban form that seems to play a major part in the fact that suburban dwellers have smaller social networks, socialize less frequently, and have fewer opportunities to meet new people compared with compact-city dwellers.\n\nBut why does the structure of the compact city facilitate social life and personal relationships? Interview data analysis suggests that this can be attributed to three factors:  more people within close proximity due to high density and centrality,  higher access to third places, and  higher access to and from other areas due to centrality and public transport.\n\nThe fact that having more people within close proximity makes socializing more accessible is explained by Festinger, Schachter, and Back  at the micro-level of a student dormitory. In the present study, this effect is extended to the macro-level of the city region and is supported by the quantitative findings from SEM which show that compactness is positively associated with the number of close relationships and the frequency of socializing. This effect is also qualitatively implied for example here:\n\nEasy to get to everyone and everything.\n\nThe people make the area to a great extent because if nobody uses cafés there wouldn't be any social life here, it wouldn't help if they  were here. But then again, if the cafés and the outdoor spaces weren't here, people wouldn't have any place to gather.\n\nThis final quote suggests that to facilitate social life both a high concentration of people and third places for them to gather are necessary. Third places vary from cafés, restaurants, and parks, to hair salons and public libraries, and are thought to nourish sociability . Indeed, local amenities are found to be positively associated with social life and personal relationships in the quantitative  presented earlier. Third places seem to influence social life and personal relationships in multiple ways. They may provide motivation for people to simply meet socially or participate in leisure activities together, and they also increase chances of spontaneously meeting preexisting or new acquaintances. Local residents may visit these places and meet other local residents or residents from other areas who are attracted by these places. Hence, third places offer opportunities for local residents to more frequently meet friends and relatives and also to make new friends or meet a new partner. These insights emerge from interviewees' responses such as the examples below:\n...socially it's very good. With all the cafés and restaurants and the parks that are around here. It's easy to find something to do. And also, most of the times if we have friends visiting or we are going out to meet friends, we end up here. Because this is where everything is happening more or less.\n\n...we can meet  here  or at the restaurant. And that offer is very good. We can choose.\n\n...that's been very practical with living here because there are so many nice places to go out, so then I can go home. So that's still an advantage.\n\nThe third factor explaining why social life is facilitated in compact neighborhoods is higher access to and from other areas. Shorter distances to other parts of the city due to centrality, and higher accessibility due to better public transport, make it easier for compact-city residents to socialize with friends and relatives. They can more easily travel to other parts of the city or other parts of the country and, in addition to this, meet suburban acquaintances who visit compact areas for work or leisure. The role of higher access to and from other areas for compactcity residents is expressed below:\n...it's easy for me to meet my friends. And also because I live so close to like the real central part, it's easy for me to go back home to my family, that is important. And just having everything I need in the area. And having people around me.\n\n... I have some friends , but mainly our friends are in this area.  we meet people from here or in the neighborhood. And even my friends, old friends from Grefsen area they... We don't have any contact with them apart from one that moved to this area.\n\nThe second quote may imply that low-density suburban dwellers tend to maintain relationships in a local context because of lower access to other areas, and this can additionally explain why low-density suburban dwellers maintain smaller social networks and enjoy fewer opportunities for socializing.",
        "18": " .\n\nFindings of this study suggest that the built environment can influence social life and personal relationships. Such findings can contribute to academic and policy debates on quality of life and urban sustainability , considering the lack of previous indepth empirical investigations on this topic. Although associated with impersonal social interactions  and weaker ties at the neighborhood level , compactness has been found to promote significantly higher overall social well-being. Indeed, even though compact-city residents may not even know the people living in the same apartment block, they do have more close relationships, with which they socialize more frequently, and they receive more emotional and functional support as compared with residents of low-density suburbs. The larger social network and support found in compact areas could lead to a decreased need for developing strong social bonds with neighbors. In fact, com-pact-city residents seem to have better chances of making a new friend or meeting a new partner despite weak neighbor ties. For all these reasons, they seem to be happier with their personal relationships.\n\nThese findings confirm claims that there are more opportunities for socializing in dense, mixed land use areas , in contrast to low-density suburban areas where people may spend less time in social activities . The study confirms that compact urban forms facilitate access to people, which has been found to be one of the reasons com-pact-city residents can be more satisfied with their neighborhood than low-density suburban residents .  may also implicitly support Festinger's idea of \"propinquity effect\" which indicates that people who live closer to one another are more likely to develop close relationships . Findings are also in agreement with the idea that local facilities are important for quality of life  and that mixed land uses may positively affect social ties . Likewise, findings empirically confirm the significance of third places on sociability and quality of life as it has been theoretically emphasized , thus providing necessary empirical evidence to urban theories .\n\nOne limitation of the study is that its quantitative part is based on a cross-sectional research design. In this paper, it is suggested that there are causal relationships between the urban form, social life, and satisfaction with personal relationships, and the  were generalized to suggest effects and influences. Since the quantitative data analyzed here are cross-sectional, the statistical effects identified indicate correlations and not necessarily causal relationships and, thus, should be interpreted with caution. Although detailed SEM, qualitative analysis, and direct questioning offer strong support for causality in this study, future research could explore this topic further using longitudinal data. Moreover, future qualitative research could provide additional insights into this topic by further exploring the role of urban form in social networks and community involvement.\n\nIt should be noted that findings reflect Oslo's context, which does not necessarily represent other urban environments and other sociocultural s. It cannot be assumed that the  would be equivalent if the examined area possessed different structural characteristics such as extremely high densities with high-rise buildings or if there were not sufficient public transport provisions and limited car usage in compact areas. Furthermore, the social context must be taken into consideration for the case of Norway and Oslo in particular. Perhaps the  might be different for a city where social inequalities are high between and within neighborhoods. Social equality is recognized as being very important for happiness in cities  and for neighborhood quality . Income inequalities in Oslo are relatively low, with income levels being high and similar on\naverage for compact and low-density suburban areas. Median values for adjusted household incomes among survey participants from these two neighborhood types are almost identical . Since other cities may differ from Oslo in terms of physical form or socioeconomic characteristics, future studies should continue to explore the relationship between the built environment and social well-being in different cities in order to provide insights from a wider set of contexts.",
        "19": " . \n\nThis paper investigates the impact of the urban form on overall social well-being by focusing on social life and personal relationships. This contribution is important because prior empirical evidence on this topic is insufficient, with most relevant studies examining social relationships only between local residents at a neighborhood level. In modern times of high education, specialization, and mobility, such local social ties are of less significance  and people are enabled to have multiple relationships all over the city region. In fact, this study of the metropolitan area of Oslo suggests that compact-city residents have higher overall social well-being than suburban residents, despite having shallower relationships at a local neighborhood level .\n\nAnother contribution of this study is that it has developed and empirically examined new conceptual models that attempt to explain how urban form may influence personal relationships satisfaction. Compared with their low-density suburban counterparts, compact-city residents are found to have a larger network of close relationships, more active social life, and stronger social support, which altogether contribute to higher satisfaction with personal relationships. As this study empirically finds, shorter distances to the city center, higher densities, and mixed land uses seem to facilitate overall social wellbeing, as also supported by some urban theories . Based on SEM  and qualitative analysis, the fact that social life and personal relationships are facilitated by compactness can be attributed to three factors relevant to its structural characteristics:  more people within close proximity due to high density and centrality,  higher access to \"third places\" , and  higher access to and from other areas due to centrality and public transport.\n\nThe outcomes of this study suggest that urban planning and design matter to quality of life as they may affect personal relationships. Based on the above findings, practitioners and decision makers may positively influence people's lives. It seems that when planned and designed appropriately, compact urban environments are beneficial for both existing personal relationships as well as for developing new ones. At a time when loneliness is increasing, this insight is especially important because of the strong influence personal relationships have on health and happiness. Moreover, the importance of these findings lies not only in their contribution to debates on quality of life, but also in their implications for environmental sustainability. These are encouraging signs for environmental sustainability, since the compact-city model, although widely acclaimed for its environmental benefits, has been largely contested for its social impact. Thus, such  could strengthen support for its implementation."
