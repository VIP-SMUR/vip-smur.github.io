        "4": " \n\nAgainst a global  of rapid urbanisation and population growth, and calls for more compact cities,  apartment development has proliferated in major Australian cities.  The influx of new apartment buildings has ignited concerns about the quality, amenity and future versatility of the housing being provided,  with potential implications for the health and well-being of apartment residents.  In response, several Australian states have developed comprehensive new apartment design guidelines, including minimum design standards. Not only do these guidelines aim to raise the quality of new apartments, but some also aspire to promote public health.  However, to date, there is little policy-specific health evidence to help to shape the content\nof apartment design guidelines, and mandate the inclusion of health-promoting design standards.",
        "5": " Apartment living and health\n\nApartment design can expose  residents from a range of environmental stressors which, in turn, can impact health and well-being.  Studies of housing and health focusing wholly, or in part, on residents of high-density housing consistently underscore the importance of natural ventilation,  thermal comfort,  sunlight access  and acoustic privacy  to a range of health and well-being outcomes. Evidence also suggests that apartment outlook onto 'natural' vegetated areas can positively impact well-being and satisfaction,  attention  and cognitive functioning.  However, there is less compelling evidence for other design attributes, such as internal space, which typically impacts health via the mechanism of crowding. \n\nAt the building-level, design features, such as communal space, green space, access arrangements, maintenance, storage and car and bicycle parking, can affect the ease and experience of apartment living, and indirectly impact health via psychosocial processes.  A review found more mental health problems among high-rise residents than those in low-rise or detached houses, and implicated social isolation as the likely explanatory pathway.  This may relate to a lack of communal space for residents to interact.  Several small studies also suggested that the design of communal spaces, and activities they supported , were important for mental health.  However, as with most apartment-level and building-level studies, these studies lack the specificity needed to inform evidence-based policy.\n\nThe building location and neighbourhood setting can also support healthier behaviours and interactions, but equally, certain neighbourhood characteristics may negatively impact residents' health. Higher densities ensure that there are sufficient people to support the local shops, services and transport that encourage active transport.  While proximate retail destinations have been associated with a range of positive outcomes ,  some unintended consequences can stem from the intensification of land-uses. Increased numbers of local destinations can inflate perceptions of crime,  and specific destinations  have been associated with crime and disorder,  increased alcohol consumption  and poorer mental health.  Further, apartment buildings are often located along major arterial roads, exposing residents to higher pollutant levels and increasing the risk of respiratory ill health and cardiovascular disease for those within  m .  Thus, the neighbourhood context may aggravate some environmental stressors experienced by apartment residents, while also directly impacting on other behaviours and processes that influence their health and well-being.\n\nApartment design policies that mandate health-promoting design requirements may play an important role in reducing social and health inequities. Apartment-level,\nbuilding-level and neighbourhood-level characteristics coalesce to create living environments that support  health. While it may be relatively easy to deliver quality apartments in more affluent settings, apartment and build quality may be compromised in peripheral suburbs or disadvantaged areas where profit margins are lower.  Further, the neighbourhood influences on health may be intensified in disadvantaged areas, which are often characterised by more disorder, crime, traffic exposure, alcohol availability and poorer amenity.  As lower-income populations typically have fewer choices about the location, design and quality of their housing,  they may be doubly disadvantaged if their building is both poorly designed and located in an unsupportive and/or health-compromising neighbourhood.",
        "6": " Apartment design policy\n\nApartments in different Australian cities have been developed under different policy environments, with considerable variation in the detail, specificity and language of the design requirements. Since , apartment buildings in New South Wales  have been developed under State Environmental Planning Policy  , which is the most comprehensive Australian design policy for apartment development. Since its , SEPP is widely considered to have improved the quality of medium-density and higher-density buildings.  This suggests that the quality of apartments delivered in other states, where design guidance has been limited, may produce poorer outcomes. However, claims that SEPP has had a positive effect on design have not been substantiated by empirical research, nor has the policy's impact on residents' health and well-being been evaluated.\n\nNevertheless, in the last few years, other Australian states have sought to improve design quality by introducing guidelines that largely emulate SEPP. In Victoria , apartment design guidance was limited,  until the  of a new guideline in . Similarly, in Western Australia , apartments were governed by a policy that primarily catered to suburban development,  until a comprehensive apartment design policy was released in ,  drawing heavily on NSW's SEPP. Indeed, several other Australian states have either drafted or proposed developing new state-specific design guidelines. \n\nThe evolution of design guidelines illustrates a dynamic policy environment and highlights a clear trend towards more comprehensive design guidance. However, there are still inconsistencies between the design guidelines, including if and where to set minimum standards. For example, NSW includes minimum size standards for different apartment types ; WA specifies minimum sizes that are larger for studios but smaller for one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments; and VIC does not stipulate minimum apartment sizes at all. These inconsistencies suggest that rather than rely on opinion or industry best practice, there is a need for an evidence base to assist policymakers to set minimum standards that promote health.\nApartment design guidelines have also become more aspirational, with some explicitly aiming to impact health. For instance, the Victorian standards aim to provide 'safe and healthy living environments' , and the WA guideline recognises the importance of good design in promoting social engagement and physical activity in inclusive, equitable communities.  This shift in emphasis in states undergoing policy transition highlights an increasing awareness within government of the role that quality apartment design could play in promoting health and well-being.",
        "7": " The High Life Study\n\nDespite numerous studies examining aspects of apartment design or higher-density living in relation to health and well-being, to date, the health evidence lacks the specificity required to adequately inform design policy.  Few studies create and analyse policy-specific design measures , to evaluate the 'on-the-ground' impact of design requirements on health. Further, no studies examine whether the holistic application of more comprehensive design guidelines improves design quality, and, in turn, enhances residents' health and well-being. They also offer little clarity on which  specific requirements should be prioritised from a health perspective, or whether the standards stipulated are sufficient to support health. The High Life Study addresses these gaps by creating policy-specific measures of apartment design and assessing their associations with residents' health and well-being.",
        "8": " Aims and objectives\n\nThe overall purpose of the High Life Study is to provide empirical evidence on the association between apartment design requirements and resident health and wellbeing outcomes to guide future policy decisions on the design and location of residential apartment buildings and contribute to the creation of healthy, equitable higher-density communities. The term 'requirements' refers to the specific content of apartment design policies and their companion guidelines. The specific research objectives are to:\n\n. Assess whether apartments built under a more comprehensive apartment design policy , incorporate more health-promoting design requirements than apartments built in jurisdictions with comparatively limited design guidance .\n. Benchmark the 'on-the-ground' implementation of health-promoting apartment design requirements in each city to assess if current development meets  the aspirations outlined in the state-specific design policies.\n. Evaluate differences in the implementation of health-promoting apartment design requirements by neighbourhood disadvantage (ie, do buildings in lower-income neighbourhoods contain fewer health-pro-\nmoting design requirements, and if so, what requirements are being excluded?).\n. Identify whether residents living in apartments incorporating more health-promoting design requirements report better health and well-being, and which specific design requirements are associated with health and well-being outcomes.?\n. Identify the wider neighbourhood contextual features  that, when paired with apartment living, are associated with health and well-being outcomes.\n. Examine the potential explanatory pathways through which apartment, building and neighbourhood design impact on residents' health and well-being .",

The study is underpinned by an ecological model, which seeks to understand multiple levels of influence on behaviour due to the constant interaction between individuals and their environments.  There are several hypothesised pathways connecting apartment design policy, and apartment and building design, with resident health and well-being outcomes. These pathways are potentially complex and influenced by the design of housing as well as its location within the broader neighbourhood context.  In addition to direct effects on health and well-being from building-induced environmental stressors , these factors can also impact health and well-being indirectly via psychosocial and behavioural impacts.

        "22": "\n\nThe High Life Study is a unique example of policy-relevant research. The study objectives and  have been developed to generate policy-specific measures and evidence, primarily by using development applications  and strata plans to generate objective measures of design policy requirements and compliance, and assess their impact on health and well-being. That is, the measurement and analysis of apartment design will be based on the planning policies and standards that underpin the provision of the buildings in the three cities. Further, the quality and amenity of the surrounding neighbourhood is a key influence on the health of local populations.  The High Life Study will also generate a comprehensive suite of objective neighbourhood measures in GIS. Analyses will both control for these neighbourhood factors and test for their independent associations with residents' health and well-being. Finally, data collection will occur across three cities where apartment development has occurred\nunder different policy regimes, and buildings have been randomly selected from a range of socioeconomic strata and within different distances of the city centre, to ensure variability in the independent  variables.\n\nThe High Life Study has a strong focus on translating evidence into policy and practice, with an overarching ambition to help to create evidence-based policy.  Australian cities are experiencing a marked increase in apartment construction,  and there is an appetite for more comprehensive, even aspirational, design guidance. The current political interest is key to policy formation; however, once enacted, policies need to be evaluated, so subsequent policy reviews-when they inevitably happen-can improve the policy .  To maximise its potential to influence policy, the High Life Study has:  consulted with, and garnered support from, state government departments and professional industry bodies involved in the design, planning, approval and development of apartment buildings;  allocated project time and resources to collaborative activities with the government agencies responsible for drafting and implementing design policy and  embedded research translation strategies, including distributing and publicising the findings to policymakers, practitioners, the wider community and academics.\n\nHousing is an important social determinant of health and well-being throughout the world. Although based in Australia, this research is timely to contribute to the goals identified in the United Nation's  Agenda for Sustainable Development.  The research aims to generate evidence on how apartment building design and location can promote health and well-being, including reducing risk factors for non-communicable disease throughout the lifespan  ). It will also provide evidence, through the investigation of neighbourhood-level influences, on several of the important challenges identified for rapidly growing cities of the future, including the provision of adequate and safe housing with access to services, and public and green space . Finally, the research will identify inequalities in health-promoting apartment design features across socioeconomic areas with the purpose of informing healthier apartment design policy to provide more equitable housing for the future . By aligning research objectives with both global agendas and local policy and planning processes, the High Life Study has the potential to create healthy, equitable higher-density communities in Australia and contribute to the broader international sustainable development agenda.\n\nThe High Life Study has several limitations. First, the study focuses on a relatively small number of apartment buildings  built between  and , which may limit the generalisability of the findings. This was necessary as the process for accessing the building plans and extracting objective apartment-level and building-level measures is time and resource intensive. However, our\nmethodology selects buildings from areas of low, mid and high disadvantage, within different distances of the city centre-maximising variability in the buildings and neighbourhood environment. Second, generalisability may be impacted by the anticipated response rate. A pilot of the study methodology generated a response rate of   and  —rates which are not uncommon for a non-personalised community postal survey in Australia.  However, the study is adequately powered to address the study objectives, and the sampling of buildings from different socioeconomic areas will help to ensure that a broad cross-section of apartment residents are included. Third, the study is cross-sectional which limits attribution of causality, although the survey instrument has been designed to be repeatable and participants will be asked to confirm their interest in participating in a subsequent longitudinal study contingent on funding. Finally, there are limitations relating to the reliance on building plans to extract the apartment and building measures, as building designs can change between what was approved for development and what was built. Steps will be taken to ensure that the plans replicate the completed building, including:  checking building plans against the strata plans ;  site visits and  the use of online real-estate sites to validate apartment layouts and numbering. Despite these limitations, the use of building plans to extract design measures specific to each participant's apartment and building remains a unique aspect and strength of the study.\n\nThe recent rise of residential apartment buildings in Australian cities has ignited concerns about the impact of poorly designed and located apartment buildings on residents' health and well-being.  Once built, apartment buildings are difficult and expensive to retrofit or rebuild, so poor design is likely to have a negative impact on both present residents and future generations. As highlighted by the Commission for Architecture and Built Environment , 'badly designed places impose costs on their occupiers, their neighbours and on society'.  While apartment design policies and guidance currently exist to direct apartment developments, their content varies across jurisdictions. Furthermore, evidence on the impact and outcomes of policy-specific design features on health and well-being is lacking. Within this context, the High Life Study aims to generate evidence to guide current policy implementation and future policy decisions on the design and location of residential apartment buildings, to ultimately improve the health and well-being of apartment residents."
