        "4": " \n\nThis paper explores how vulnerable consumers within systematic constraints of economic inequality, institutional barriers, and social segregation in an urban environment cope with their vulnerabilities to achieve their well-being. Taking China's internal migrant workers as a research context, our study examines their vulnerable experiences and reveals the impact of systematic constraints on migrant workers' self-perception, interpretation, and actions. It discovers a staged process through which migrant workers acquire resilience to optimize life satisfaction by fulfilling a sense of control over their migration life. Through a situated approach to capture the contextual impact of systematic constraints on vulnerability experiences and the construction of resilient pathways to achieve well-being, this paper puts forward critical welfare issues such as inclusive marketplace, social capital, and community empowerment which are important to migrants' social integration and capability building. This calls for more coordinated efforts to promote effective resilience building and sustained well-being among resource-constrained consumers.resilience, systematic constraints, well-being\nThe phenomenon of massive internal migration triggered by urbanization in developing countries has been long ignored by researchers . Through rural to urban migration it was predicted that urban population size would be doubled by  . The economists have resonated that migration is an escape route out of poverty . Within Chinese context, migrants are or have been migrating from poor villages to urban cities to pursue remunerative livelihood opportunities in urban places. Yet, they are experiencing discrimination and denial during the movement, largely due to a lack of urban hukou, a social system linked with the entitlement and benefits for residents in China. These chronic experiences have produced a state of internal powerlessness and exclusion from the dominant marketplace among internal migrants. It is imperative for them to be resilient to be able to cope with the adversity they face in an urban environment. While there is an emerging scholarship on the issue of systematic constraints and consumer vulnerability , there remains a significant gap of knowledge in understanding how internal migrants cope with the vulnerability originated from the systematic constraints to produce their well-being. This research aims to take the perspectives of consumer vulnerability and resilience to understand well-being production among internal migrants facing systematic constraints. The findings will reveal the empirical realities where poverty, mobility, and deprivation coexist and interact to create migrants' vulnerability and trigger reconfiguration of resources as coping strategies to gain resilience and achieve well-being.\n\nConsumer vulnerability is commonly conceptualized as a state of powerlessness, which arises from an interaction of individual characteristics ; individual states , and external conditions  . Vulnerable consumers have also been referred to as \"at-risk consumers,\" with limited ability to engage in a marketplace . Zooming in the consumer vulnerability among internal migrant workers in China with a focus on consumer resilience, this research initiates a much-needed on the process of well-being production among vulnerable consumers. It makes three major contributions to the existing literature. Our study firstly contributes to the consumer vulnerability literature by tapping into the under-researched area of consumer vulnerability that arises from systematic constraints in a transitional economy, which represents a complex, dynamic unresolvable situation . Vulnerable consumers in transitional economies, such as internal migrants, are likely to face significant regulatory constraints, for example, hukou in China, propiska in Russia, and caste in India. These constraints are different from the institutional forces in other economies in that they trigger constraints in other domains, resulting in a unique nexus of consumer vulnerabilities. There is burgeoning scholarship on the issues of systemic restricted choices and consumer constraints in the marketplace . However, the complexity of person-environment interaction in transitional economies, as well as the impact of systematic constraints on creating and coping with consumer vulnerability, are poorly understood. The existing body of work has resulted in a prescribed range of coping strategies, as if they are universals uninfluenced by social and economic contexts .\n\nSecond, resilience has emerged as a contemporary theoretical concept linked to constraints and vulnerability at both the individual level  and the community level , yet it remains broadly as an under-researched area within consumer research and marketing discipline . Resilience is argued to be a strength-related resource and capacity to bounce back and forge lasting strengths in the struggle. However, how is resilience acquired and practiced when consumers encounter systematic\nconstraints? Is resilience always positive and functional to alleviate consumer vulnerability? Our study contributes to the about resiliency inquiry by empirically answering these important yet unanswered questions and reframing resilience as a context-sensitive dynamic concept.\n\nThird, our study ultimately addresses issues of consumer well-being, which is one critically important topic among migration issues . In this research, we focus on life satisfaction, which is a core indicator of subjective well-being  . In particular, we focus on understanding how migrant workers produce their life satisfaction in the face of systematic constraints, hence, treating consumer well-being as a lived experience, rather than a static concept. Our study contributes to building a process theory of consumer well-being to capture its dynamic nature.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. First, we introduce China as the research context withs on systematic constraints and Chinese migrant workers' well-being. Next, we present a literature review of consumer vulnerability and resilience as the theoretical lens for this research. We then report a qualitative study and its findings. The paper concludes with a of theoretical contributions and managerial implications for promoting well-being among systematically constrained consumers.",
        "5": "  \n\nChina has the largest rural-urban floating population in the world, with more than  million migrant workers with an average monthly income of about , yuan or USD  $ . The most unique characteristic that distinguishes the pattern of migration in China from those in other countries is China's household registration system . Hukou system has become an integral part of China's social stratification system over time. It is linked with the entitlement and benefits for residents in China, including employment, food coupons, health insurance, housing, and school for children in the local community. Rural migrants do not have an urban hukou when they migrate to an urban city. Therefore, they are barred from receiving equal social welfare and benefits available to local residents, though they are entitled to the social welfare and benefits within rural hukou system.\n\nBeing unregistered in the urban hukou system, migrant workers are inevitably situated in an initially disadvantageous position during their migration to urban cities. They are often stigmatized in the new environment because the lack of local hukou has marked them as different and makes them devalued in the eyes of others . This institutionally enforced discrimination against migrant workers has crucial consequences for their employment, wages, and housing choices. Most migrant workers work under informal employment conditions that are labor-intensive and low-waged without job security and social protection . Most urban migrants spend many hours daily commuting to work, as many of them live in suburban dormitories far from their workplace . In many aspects, migrant workers seem both physically and psychologically segregated from local urban residents.\n\nIn addition to low economic assimilation among migrant workers, their self-identification and cultural assimilation are even lower and progress slowly. Their common images portrayed by the media are \"'dirty', 'ignorant', 'distrustful' and 'violent'\" . Migrant\nworkers have been most \"marginalized\" in the urban marketplace , being inaccessible by media, geographically isolated, and inexperienced with consumption. As culturally distinct and inferior \"others,\" migrant workers are the vulnerable consumers in urban cities who struggle to maintain the conventional standard of living and cannot hope to afford material status symbols as local urbanites do. A lack of presence in the mainstream urban marketplace has led to further social exclusion and discrimination against migrant workers which affect their overall well-being .\n\nWell-being has been traditionally considered as an indicator of affluence and higher quality of life, which includes objective social indicators, such as income and houses, as well as subjective ones, such as perception of well-being . This research is focused on SWB, defined as how and why people experience their lives in positive ways of cognitive judgments and affective reactions . A core indicator of SWB is life satisfaction, referring to individuals' emotional and cognitive evaluations of their lives . It embraces human diversity and incorporates social, economic, and other aspects of what constitutes a fulfilled human life. Compared with local residents in urban cities, migrant workers perceive and interpret what a good life is in a different way, which occurs as a function of many complex person-situation interactions and a consequence of their transition into and out of vulnerability . Migration experiences break down the stable market forces and community connections previously appreciated by migrant workers in their hometowns  when they are thrown into a new life situation with unexpected challenges. When they struggle to survive and thrive in new social and cultural settings, migrant workers will be experiencing revolutionary and evolutionary changes in their lives as well as in themselves . Migrants with higher aspirations move to and settle in large cities expecting more career opportunities and a better life. Yet without an urban hukou, they are exposed to greater constraints in urban cities, as well as a severe culture of exploitation and discrimination.\n\nThe massive internal migration within China provides an important and comparative research context where migrant workers are emerging as a result of sweeping social and institutional transformations. The urbanization process in China is more of an \"urbanization of place\" than \"urbanization of people\" . Without an urban hukou, migrant workers face systematic constraints of institutional barriers, economic inequality, and social segregation, which collectively form a nexus of vulnerability, leading to multiple jeopardies and simultaneous oppressions  to their achievement of well-being. How do migrant workers cope with such vulnerability caused by systematic constraints in their migration life? How do they adapt to survive and build pathways to subdue the pains and achieve life satisfaction? These are relevant and important questions towards constructing a thorough understanding of the well-being of vulnerable consumers facing systematic constraints, but they are yet to be sufficiently answered. We aim to address these questions in this study.",
        "6": "  \n\nConsumer vulnerability has a rich and varied tradition for well-being research arising primarily as a theoretical lens to study at-risk groups, social injustices, and hazardous situations . It was firstly proposed by .  as a state of powerlessness. More recently, Hill and Sharma  proposed a more comprehensive definition that consumer vulnerability is a state in which consumers are subject to harm because their access to and control\nover resources is restricted in ways that significantly inhibit their abilities to function in the marketplace. Central to these key definitions are the level of control and resources possessed by consumers. Less control, such as more dependence on external factors , and more restricted resources, including individual, interpersonal, and structural resources , are associated with higher consumer vulnerability.\n\nOver the past decades the concept of consumer vulnerability has experienced an evolving articulation and provided a unifying label of a variety of studies focused on different populations in a wide range of marketing contexts, including individuals with physical, cognitive and behavioral impairment , consumers with limited English proficiency , low income women  and adolescents , among others. These works have significantly advanced our knowledge of consumer vulnerability, however, they have adopted a demographic approach in vulnerability analysis , which indicates that some categories of people, due to their membership in a defined class, are always vulnerable, that is, the problems that create the vulnerability residing within the individual . While individual characteristics and states contribute to vulnerability, vulnerability is not an automatic by-product of an individual state, characteristic, or condition. Instead, it must include an experiential component that arises from the interaction between a person and all of his/her personal characteristics within a consumption situation .\n\nAnother way to examine consumer vulnerability is the situational approach , which we adopted in this research. Situational approach takes a dynamic perspective on consumer vulnerability that considers a person embedded in a particular situation , thus, treating consumer vulnerability as being fluid, situational, and experienced . Vulnerability is determined by examining the nature of the actual situation and the reality of everyday lives , that is, it is the circumstances consumers face that determine their vulnerability . The situational approach allows for understanding the multitude of factors that may contribute to vulnerability and the heterogeneity of needs and responses to vulnerability . This indicates that the combination of control and resources leading to consumer vulnerability  is not prescribed but contextually bound. For example, the systematic constraints that migrant workers in China face would result in the loss of certain control as well as resources that produces their vulnerability. They may demand different types of control and resource sets to be regained and acquired to cope with the vulnerability. Vulnerability emerges as an outcome of interactions among personal, economic, social, and environmental conditions. It is not a fixed, objective and static state but, rather, processual and socially constructed . In this research, we argue that the interplay between migrants' culture of origin and the local culture, as well as between their self-evolution and the changing external environment where systematic constraints exist, could play critical roles in shaping their paths into and out of vulnerability that would further affect their life satisfaction. The situational perspective of consumer vulnerability offers a sensitive theoretical tool to capture these interactive effects and contextual influences, facilitating the understanding of well-being production among migrant workers.\n\nConsumer vulnerability induces resilient behaviors when individuals take efforts to transform their material, social, and/or ecological environments to reduce its negative impacts and improve their well-being . Resilience is associated with meanings of the ability to bounce back from stress and adversity  and maintain a stable equilibrium in the face of stress . It is the motivational force that drives\nindividuals to seek self-actualization, wisdom, and harmony . Resilience reflects the capacity of individuals to adjust to threats and changes.\n\nDespite its importance as a well-being-related construct and how it might act as a stress mediator during times of constraints, resilience has not been explored to any greater degree in the consumer vulnerability and well-being literature, hence, remaining to be an emerging construct in this domain . We use resilience as a useful framework for researching an under-represented consumer population, that is, the internal migrants in China, in our study. We contribute to the literature by revealing how resilience is acquired and practiced as a pathway to achieve life satisfaction when consumers struggle with vulnerability originated from systematic constraints.",
        "7": "  \n\nQualitative  offer insights into the daily strategies and coping mechanisms used by vulnerable consumers . In this research we adopted an interpretive approach in the form of in-depth interviews to explore various life domains of migrant workers. Following the theoretical sampling principles ,  migrant workers living in Shanghai, China were recruited for interviews. All the subjects have been living and working in Shanghai for  to  years, yet none of them have been granted an urban hukou in Shanghai. They work as street venders, cooks, cleaners, factory workers, truck drivers, and secretaries for small businesses. Their annual incomes range from , yuan  to , yuan , far below the average annual salary of , yuan  in Shanghai  . As unstructured questions would more likely to be misinterpreted , semistructured in-depth individual interviews were conducted with an average length of  min . Informants were encouraged and given time in the interviews to introduce and discuss additional relevant issues  to their evaluation of life satisfaction. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.\n\nA hermeneutical approach was adopted to analyze the data, which involves an iterative and continuous process of interpreting and comparing texts to build a logical chain of evidences for conceptual coherence . Two steps were taken to complete the data analysis. First, we analyzed each interview as a stand-alone entity to allow unique patterns to emerge. Interview transcripts were analyzed multiple times to identify relevant and important themes and separate from tangential ones . Second, we conducted a cross-case analysis to search for generalizable themes, patterns, and intergroup differences . Two researchers were engaged in this process and ran the analysis independently. The findings were then compared and led to further probing of data when differences were identified. Additional insights were obtained out of this process. An iterative fashion was followed until no new insights were identified in data, indicating that theoretical saturation was achieved . Throughout the analysis, particular attention was given to the subsistence context in which the subjects were low-income migrant workers settled in an urban city yet without a local hukou such that they were denied access to social benefits. The vigilance of this context helped focus our analysis and interpretation on the focal phenomenon regarding how systematically constrained migrant workers perceive their well-being in an urban environment.",
        "8": "  \n\nOur data show that migrant workers feel satisfied as long as they are able to meet basic needs, such as living a healthy life, raising children, being together with families and receiving a stable income. Migrating to urban cities increases migrant workers' constraints by reducing their opportunities to achieve life satisfaction due to a lack of local hukou, and by increasing the costs of some means of life satisfaction production , such as providing education to children and obtaining medical services. To cope with these constraints and changes, migrant workers reduce their efforts in the attainment of instrumental goals related to material gains and social status but focus more on achieving well-being through internal comfort and affection which are relatively easier to produce. In this section, we report findings of major themes that specify how migrant workers build and practice their resilience to cope with their vulnerability and produce life satisfaction. Appendix B provides more quotes from interviews that support the findings.",
        "9": " . \n\nThe majority of migrant workers are from underprivileged families in poverty-stricken areas in China. They leave their hometowns with little money but aspiration for opportunities in urban cities. To earn more money is the main motivation for migration and the only expectation when they first start the migration life. However, without local hukou, many migrant workers have to take undesirable jobs with low pays when they first arrive in cities.\n\"When I first came to Shanghai, I worked in a restaurant as an apprentice. They didn't pay me but offered me free accommodation and meals. I slept on chairs in the restaurant for free. Six months later they began to pay me at a minimum level, which was  yuan per month. There was strong discrimination in the workplace against migrant workers from rural areas. They either paid you little or nothing at all. I took the job because I needed it to survive in Shanghai.\" \n\nOur data show that having a secured job is a major source of life satisfaction. Job security is highly appreciated and provides migrant workers with a much-needed relief from the pressure of living away from home. They are happy with what they earn, yet fully aware of how low their incomes are, as expressed by Mr. Yin , \"I am happy with my salary, but it cannot be compared with those of Shanghainese.\" A mixed feeling is felt through the data. On one hand, migrant workers are proud of having a job with stable income in urban cities which offers a much-needed sense of relief from the pressure of living away from home. On the other hand, migrant workers are fully aware of their differences with local residents yet realizing slim chances to change without a local hukou . The institutional inequality caused by the hukou system in China has denied migrant workers equal employment opportunities in urban cities, hence, leaving them in a financially vulnerable position. To cope with it, migrant workers deliberately avoid comparing themselves with local residents when interpreting their incomes. Instead, they adopt a reference point referring to their past levels or other migrant workers who are in similar or\nworse conditions. As a result, their perception of current incomes could be higher than the actual level. Their acceptance of institutional inequality leads to the acceptance of low incomes through downward social comparison. This coping strategy helps to dilute the sense of vulnerability among migrant workers and enhance their perceived life satisfaction. However, underneath it permeates a sense of contentedness emerging from the powerlessness to change and improve their life situations. \"Life is out of my own control. No matter how hard I work, I won't get all that I want.\" said Ms. Han .",
        "10": " .  \n\nSocial ties, including social groups, peers, and neighbors, are important resources for consumption capacities in the process of changing . Our findings echo this point with the discovery of migrant workers' strong connections with family members and friends as another key resource available for them to produce life satisfaction. The relatedness that they achieve out of these social resources helps them to gain strength and confidence when being isolated from the mainstream marketplace in an urban environment.\n\nOur data show that migrant workers have or wish to have strong attachment to their families. All married couples among our interviewees live together in Shanghai, which is a blessing to them when settling in a difficult urban environment . Our interviewees also stay closely connected to their extended families, including parents, siblings, and other family members back in the hometown. They make regular calls to their parents in the hometown and visit families there between twice a year and once every  years. The family closeness observed in this research reveals that when material norms are of low standard, social well-being is likely to be substituted for physical one, implicating that emotional needs become more valued than material wealth to achieve life satisfaction .\n\nBeyond family members migrant workers also reach out to build and expand their social networks in urban cities. However, our data show that as they settle in cities, the social networks of migrant workers remain to be dominantly composed of other migrant workers mostly from the same hometown, with an apparent absence of local Shanghainese. All the interviewees report good working relationships with their local colleagues in workplace , yet they seldom contact after work and never see each other as friends. \"Though I get along well with my colleagues, we seldom hang out after work. We chat well at work but still feel the distance after work,\" said Ms. Li . Further investigation of the data reveals the mechanism behind this. Though settled in Shanghai, the migrant workers still see themselves as outsiders in the city, as expressed by Mr. Li , \"I still feel I am nonShanghainese after living here for  years. It is not my home.\" Home is defined by migrant workers as a place where they own a property and have local household registration. Their low income cannot afford them a property in Shanghai. Even worse is that the policy does not support them to be granted a local Hukou, indicating fewer chances for them to increase the income. As they live in the city long enough, they are used to the inequality and lose hope for change. \"Of course, I want to be a Shanghainese, but it is impossible for me to get the local hukou, so hope is of no use at all.\" . The acceptance of\ninstitutional and economic inequality gives migrant workers less confidence and interest in reaching out to make friends with local people. Instead, they are more inclined to adopt passive networking strategies to stay with proximate others  for support and a sense of belonging, rather than proactive strategies to expand social networks to those from different s. This reflects another application of downward social comparison strategy among migrant workers to interpret their life situations and produce life satisfaction. By comparing with other people under similar or worse conditions, their perceived status quo could be better than the actual situation, leading to a more positive perception of life satisfaction.\n\nWhen migrant workers are away from home and face deepened social divisions arising from regulatory constraints, loneliness is felt by most of them. \"After work I only watch TV by myself. I don't have anyone to chat with here, and I don't want to call my friends in the hometown every day\" . Even for Ms. Han who has lived in Shanghai for  years, she has \"no best friend in Shanghai. They are all in hometown.\" They are emotionally hungry when living in urban cities. As a result, instead of actively seeking help from their social networks in the face of adversity, migrant workers are more likely to keep them as resources to fill emotional voids in their lonely migration life as uncovered in our data. In particular, they tend to avoid sharing negative feelings and attempt to feel positive emotions from families and friends. \"I didn't tell my family or friends I know to help me with job-hunting. I wanted to search by myself, otherwise, I owe them a big favour. If I didn't get the job, I would be laughed at by others. So I don't want to bother others and just looked for a job by myself,\" said Mr. Wang . This finding of the use of social networks further indicates that migrant workers rely more on individual efforts rather than developing collective coping resources to improve their life situations.",
        "11": " .  \n\nIt is discovered in our data that though earning little, migrant workers still manage to save money through highly disciplined spending and strict budget planning. \"I seldom buy clothes as I can wear one clothes for a long time\" . During leisure time, most of migrant workers choose to do things with no cost, such as watching TV, chatting with friends, and going to parks with kids. \"We don't go out often because I don't want to spend money,\" said Mr. Lu . The majority of migrant workers see it as a satisfying way of spending leisure time with no-or-low-cost activities. Migrant workers are all price-sensitive and some of them only buy discounted products in shops. When shopping for clothes, the price is the most important factor to consider, followed by fitness. Brand is rarely mentioned by interviewees, indicating its least importance to them when making purchase decisions.\n\nAll the interviewees have bank cards but use cash more often when shopping and paying bills. They feel it is more reliable to deal with cash and believe they have better control of the money when doing so. Having full control of money is an important sign of autonomy in life for migrant workers. Migrant workers feel a stronger sense of security from tangible products. They seldom shop online because \"you can't see exactly what you buy, so money may be wasted there\" . For those that go shopping online, they have strict control of spending that they would withdraw money from their online shopping account immediately after the transaction is complete to avoid a shopping spree. Migrant workers would set strict budget for living costs. For example, Mr. Yin (-year-old,  years in\nShanghai) lives on a budget of  yuan  per month for grocery shopping and  yuan  for clothing.\n\nThese observations reveal a risk-averse and conservative attitude toward money spending among migrant consumers and indicate the importance of financial security to them. Their life satisfaction develops not necessarily through immediate consumption but non-consumption . Having savings are perceived to be more important than spending for migrant workers. It gives them a sense of security which is not easily felt in the workplace and marketplace. \"A good life is when you can have a job and also have some savings\" .\n\nOur data further reveals that migrant workers save money without having plans for investment or purchase of major products . Some migrant workers save money for the future needs of their families, in particular, sponsoring children's education and taking care of aging parents, while others would save money for self-development and starting up a new business in the future . Another purpose for saving, as disclosed in the findings, is to support future retirement life back in the hometown, with an emphasis on emergencies. With savings, migrant workers achieve a stronger sense of independence and control in life, as well as more confidence in the future of their family and themselves.\n\nThe limited financial resources do not allow migrant workers to engage in hedonic consumptions to seek life satisfaction. However, our data show that migrant workers are more frequently involved in family supporting activities. They are generous in providing financial support to their families, such as sending money back and buying gifts to family members when visiting home. In return, they received enriched and satisfying emotional experiences that help alleviate the pains of a lack of material wealth compared with local residents in Shanghai. \"We go back home every year for Chinese New Year and usually would spend between ,-,RMB on gifts and red packets for family members. It's a lot of money for us but we are glad to do so for the family and see them being happy.\" .",
        "12": " .\n\nOur findings reveal that securing a job that offers a stable income to make ends meet becomes the priority for migrant workers, instead of pursuing dream jobs or career development. Change is less desired in the migration life as it means risks more than opportunities. There is a clear lack of interest in long-term plans among migrant workers, as evidenced in the following observations. An avoidance orientation  is noted which reflects migrant workers' coping strategy of the environment filled with uncertainties. Deeply embedded in it is their fear for loss in their already vulnerable life situations, as observed in the following evidence.\n\"I have no plan for the future as I am just settled in my job. My job is OK. I do not care much what the job is so long as I am able to keep it. At least this job enables me to make my life here settled, and I can have regular flow of income to raise my child and support my family.\" \nMigrant workers have positive vision for life when they have a job and savings. They set clear short-term goals, indicating their interest in living in the present instead of hoping for the future. Two major themes are noted in their goal-setting, that is, to give their children better education for a brighter future and/or to earn more money for a better quality of life for the family. The goals reflect altruistic motives and family orientation of migrant workers when they plan for their future.\n\"We don't have a big plan for the future. My major concern is how to make more money. I do not know how, but just work hard every day and do my best. The other thing we wish for is that our son can receive better education. So when he grows up, he can get a decent job and make good money. When he gets married and has his own child, we will help him with the baby so he could continue to work.\" \n\nOur findings further reveal that migrant workers tend to lower their expectations for what they can have and achieve in the city life to deliberately avoid direct comparison with local residents. An observation from the data is when migrant workers set goals for earning more money in the future, they refer to a low standard of wealth to be achieved in urban cities, such as earning an annual household income of , yuan , which is far below the average salary in Shanghai of , yuan or USD  ,$ annually. This points to the fact that life satisfaction does not necessarily come from ambitious goals but reflects the extent to which people feel they will achieve those goals . The short-term goals are practically set by migrant workers based on their perception of current financial status and judgment of feasibility. They only dream what they can do to maintain a positive mood. Their confidence in achieving these short-term goals helps them to stay strong and hopeful when facing constraints in urban lives, which, in turn, positively influences their perception of life satisfaction.\n\nIn summary, findings in this study reveal a nested hierarchy of constraints faced by migrant workers living in urban cities. The regulatory constraints caused by the hukou system in China has a downward spiral effect that triggers more economic and social constraints to migrant workers, including workplace inequality, marketplace exclusion, and social segregation. Without an urban hukou, migrant workers are dragged into a life situation characterized by stigmatization, subordination and segregation at work and in the marketplace . As a result, migrant workers experience vulnerabilities of institutional deprivation, such as job insecurity and denial to the social welfare in urban cities, together with financial anxiety, social exclusion, and emotional void. It is noteworthy in the findings that migrant workers have accepted the reality with systematic constraints and take them as routines in their urban life, such that they seem to be less disruptive . A sense of \"learned helplessness\" and being habitualized with the status quo are obvious in the findings. Yet, at the same time, migrant workers are seeking resilient pathways to cope with vulnerabilities and produce higher life satisfaction. Resilient pathways are trajectories to well-being . They act as conduits to the adaptation, allowing migrant workers to assert themselves in the vulnerable context and circumvent the strain that surrounds them. Migrant workers build their resilience by developing coping attitudes of being family-oriented and risk-averse, as well as avoiding upward social comparison, which guide their coping behaviors of seeking job security, social networking, spending and goal setting. With their abilities to prosper materially in urban cities remaining in doubt, migrant workers adapt to their life situation with a practical focus on\nmaintaining current lives where essential needs are met and a positive near future can be envisioned. They rely on family connections to fulfill emotional needs and gain confidence through investing and engaging in family supporting activities. Their risk-averse approaches adopted in managing money and setting goals, together with downward social comparison strategies in interpreting low incomes and developing social networks, turn out to be sensible and effective to reduce the uncertainty in their migration life. These coping strategies are planned to optimize the achievements of a sense of control over their life when they live in an ever-changing urban environment filled with uncertainties. Sense of control is highly related to life satisfaction . It indicates the extent to which migrant workers feel autonomous about the way they lead a life. Autonomy is one of the fundamental psychological needs to be met for people to experience fulfillment . Yet for migrant workers who are vulnerable to changes in their life due to systematic constraints, the fundamental need of autonomy becomes aspirational, whose acquisition is the building block of their resilience and determines their perception of life satisfaction. Figure  summarizes the findings, which will be discussed in detail in the next section.",
        "13": "  \n\nThe multiple constraints triggered by the hukou system in China have created a complex, dynamic, and unresolvable situation  leading to a nexus of vulnerability to migrant workers. They are aware of the problem, that is, their nonurban-hukou status, yet have no access to the means of solving the problem, that is, obtaining an urban hukou. The vulnerability originated from the institutional inequality ripples onward to create secondary vulnerability  of financial anxiety, social exclusion, and emotional void. The system-rooted vulnerability is a lived experience for migrant workers that brings complex, unpredictable, and long-lasting disruptions to their urban life. Our research has identified distinct coping trajectories showing how migrant workers acquire and practice resilience to optimize achievements and produce well-being within the environmental and functional limitations they face. Migrant workers shape resilient pathways through interpreting and adapting to the life situation, changing preferences, and shifting activities, out of which they satisfy the psychological need for sense of control over the uncertainty-filled migration life, which, ultimately, produces higher life satisfaction. This observation reflects the operation of substitution mechanism  in acquiring resilience when life situation changes. It indicates that resilience is determined by how migrants perceive, interpret, and respond to the objective circumstances. Migrant workers' interpretation of their life situations, which leads to intentional cognitions and behaviors, is a strong driving force to construct resilient pathways\n\nFIGURE  Summary of qualitative inquiries: Resilient pathways to well-being by migrant workers facing systematic constraints\nleading to well-being production. In other words, there is no guarantee that people in the same objective circumstances  will follow the same resilient pathways toward the same level of life satisfaction . This argument provides an important shift to a dynamic view of consumer well-being, which has been dominantly treated as a static variable influenced by a set of factors. Well-being as a human experience, in essence, is person-specific and context-sensitive. This is in contrast to traditional marketing approaches which have overwhelmingly emphasized the principles of consumer sovereignty and economic gain in consumer well-being, neglecting the social-cultural aspect of consumption related to consumer well-being .\n\nPossession of resources is instrumental in resilience, but an individual's well-being is dependent on the access to and use of resources within his/her particular ecological niche to be adaptive . In light of this, resilient pathways reflect a process of how migrant workers functionalize limited personal and environmental resources to maximize the production of well-being. As manifested in Figure , resilient pathways initiate with consciously adjusting beliefs and attitudes, based on migrant workers' interpretation of life situations and experienced vulnerability. The shifted beliefs and attitudes influence how migrant workers allocate and use resources in various coping behaviors to meet the priority need, the fulfillment of which will produce higher life satisfaction. Our findings reveal that maximizing sense of life control over their vulnerable lives is a priority for migrant workers to gain resilience and produce well-being. To achieve it, migrant workers are engaged in four coping behaviors , guided by their attitudes of being family oriented, avoiding upward social comparison and being risk-averse.\n\nWith restricted access to external resources, migrant workers turn to the most accessible internal resources of families to seek comfort and security to be resilient when facing adversity. As revealed in our findings, family orientation has influenced migrant workers' goal setting and spending behaviors. They put their families as first priority when planning for future, setting family-related goals such as sponsoring full education to their children, and earning more money to better support families. Migrant workers are restrained from consumption but generous in providing financial support to their families. Being able to take care of and make financial contribution to their families has produced a strong sense of achievement among migrants, which helps to offset the frustration from earning low incomes and being discriminated in urban cities. Being family oriented in allocating limited financial resources, thus, becomes an effective approach for migrant workers to be resilient in gaining control over their life and achieving well-being with limited resources available. This finding provides a different interpretation of what matters for migrant workers regarding their well-being. Extant literature posits that vulnerable consumers enhance their well-being by recognizing and satisfying their own needs through obtaining and consuming products . This market-centric perspective emphasizes consumption as necessary for a good life . Our study does not support such materialistic view but rather, argues that migrant workers adopt relational coping , that is, caring for others, to achieve life satisfaction. They invest limited financial resources on familyoriented activities, which reward them with positive relational resources, such as enhanced family bonding, respect, and acknowledgment from family members, for managing the adverse effects of systematic constraints in their migration life.\n\nSocial capital is a necessary bridge for resource attainment among migrant workers, as they often find it hard, if not impossible, to seek psychological and material restoration on their own . An important finding in this study is that systematic constraints do not\nreduce social capitals among migrant workers. Instead, social capitals are more needed for resilience building in their migration lives. However, the awareness of the systematic constraints and the vulnerabilities caused affect their social networking strategies. As a result, migrant workers develop their social capital involving different nature and content, but not necessarily less and weaker.\n\nA noteworthy finding is that migrant workers are engaged in intense social comparisons with people similar to themselves but deliberately avoiding upward social comparisons with local residents. This preference  in the acceptance of their low income to seek job satisfaction and inward social networking to seek social identification with an endemic identity . Rather than pursue status and access to economic resources as key benefits from social connections , migrant workers adapt their expectations to seek peer support and emotional bonding within the narrow and homogeneous social networks . The similar value orientation, life experiences and urban living conditions experienced by other migrants dilute the feelings of \"possession gap\" but strengthen \"position gain\" in social status , which generates feelings of life control and life satisfaction. Having a positive adjustment to negative experiences is a central theme of resilience . Our findings provide new insights of the role of social capitals in facilitating such adjustment in the face of systematic constraints.\n\nAnother significant finding of this study is that the awareness of systematic constraints and the acceptance of vulnerabilities affect migrant workers' confidence in dealing with uncertainties, hence, influencing their attitude toward risk taking. They are more likely to be avoidance-oriented to reduce the risk of loss in life . The preference for risk aversion has impacted migrant workers' behaviors of spending and future planning. Saving is of paramount importance to migrant workers as it has signaling effects on gaining sense of security and control. When planning for their future, migrant workers are more focused on achieving short-term goals for immediate happiness to avoid long-term uncertainty. This indicates a contingency approach in interpreting the effectiveness of loss-focused risk-aversion strategy in coping with hardships in life. Among vulnerable consumers such as migrant workers, they seek positive emotions such as sense of control to move away from vulnerability and toward recovery. Sense of control could be fostered through goal attainment strategies , which motivate migrant workers to set less ambitious but achievable goals with their limited resources. Risk-aversion orientation could be effective for migrant workers to acquire resilience and enhance life satisfaction.\n\nThe process of how migrant workers become resilient when coping with vulnerability reflects their concentrating efforts to reduce the uncertainty in the migration life to produce well-being using all personal and environmental resources at hand. Our findings have identified resilient pathways forged by migrant workers that involve attitudinal and behavioral coping. These pathways lead to the achievement of sense of control over life, and ultimately, life satisfaction, both of which are key indicators for resilient qualities . In this sense, the resilient pathways are effective for migrant workers to deal with their vulnerability in urban cities. However, it is notable in the findings that an overall avoidance strategy with short-term orientation is dominant in the process of coping adversity, change and stresses caused by the systematic constraints. This sheds important lights on the functionality of resilience from a long-term perspective. Instead of building power to change the stressor such as institutional inequality and financial anxiety, migrant workers choose to change their feelings toward their stressor . They rely on utilizing internal resources, such as families and friends, to seek empathy and comfort, and focus on developing\nemotional resources and building emotional power. This indicates an emotion-focused coping response to reduce negative feelings that arise in response to vulnerability, rather than a problem-focused approach with cognitive and behavioral attempts to remove or diminish the impact of constraints . Migrant workers seldom leverage social capital to empower community spirit , or to gain access to future development . Instead, they are leaning toward developing and maintaining inward social networks with similar others to produce security and confidence. These findings indicate liability-of-foreignness effects . As migrant workers mingle with each other, their rural village connections are strengthened, resulting in a more salient foreign identity they are perceived to have in the market. Avoidance of social networking with local communities in urban cities may be an effective coping strategy for migrant workers to defeat the stress of living as outsiders in urban cities, though the grassroots actions of sticking to a closed social network do not contribute to consumer empowerment .\n\nThe avoidance strategy with short-term orientation among migrant workers has triggered passive uses of coping resources to build resilience with a focus on surviving rather than empowerment building. Such resilience works in the short term to achieve well-being by producing positive emotions but the compromised passive coping strategies could be detrimental to migrant workers' future development and their freedom with equal citizenships. With little effort directed to remediate the underlying causes of vulnerability, migrant workers are not empowered by being resilient to be ready to be engaged in the mainstream marketplace. The resilience that is functional in the short term will turn to be dysfunctional in the long run with a gradual loss of energy for making positive changes , hence, aggravating the vulnerability migrant workers face over time. These findings are significant as they lead to a view to adopt capability approach to understanding how resilience functions and contributes to wellbeing production. Capabilities are the options, the possibilities and the abilities to reach and achieve the desired state . For migrant workers who are resource-poor and facing systematic constraints, their vulnerability is not necessarily associated with poverty, but more importantly, a lack of capabilities to empower themselves in a challenging urban environment, which consequently subverts their ability to build strength and choose the lives they value . Their well-being should be evaluated through a combination of what they value having, doing or being, and their capability to realize these functionings . The life contexts in their entirety need to be considered in order to identify the critical hindrances and to find a contextually determined specific mix of capabilities that can overcome hindrance and enable a growth in well-being . Our study confirmed migrants' self-interpretation and adaptation toward a desired state to produce well-being in face of systematic constraints. However, there is a clear lack of force throughout the resilient pathways that drives migrants to seek abilities to act and bring about positive changes to achieve a higher state of existence , hence, limiting the strength of resilience attained and its effectiveness in recovering from vulnerability and promoting well-being in the long run.",
        "14": "   \n\nA lack of access to urban hukou, constrained consumption and limited resources have excluded migrant workers from the dominant marketplace and social security system in urban cities, which complicates their migration experiences and places them in vulnerable positions. Yet\nlittle is known about how these systematically constrained consumers cope with vulnerability and produce their well-being. Our research has contributed to improving knowledge in this area. Through the robust theoretical lens of consumer vulnerability and resilience, our study identifies the impact of systematic constraints on consumer vulnerability and how migrant workers shape their resilient pathways to deal with vulnerability and achieve life satisfaction. We have also specified distinctive multiple resilient pathways, which demonstrate a progressive practice of need assessment and fulfillment through effective distribution of limited resources. Our study shifts the attention from applying a set of measurements to assess migrant workers' well-being to discovering processes by which they produce and achieve well-being . The findings extend the conventional notion of well-being by identifying it as a sum of experiences  driven by consumers' self-interpretation, adaptation, and capability of being flexible and strategic in resource management. Consumer well-being is fluid and socially constructed, rather than being fixed and objective following the more-is-better assumption.\n\nOur research has a few important theoretical implications to the literature of consumer vulnerability and resilience. This research takes a situated approach to examining the vulnerability experienced by an emerging and prevalent market segment of migrant workers. It reveals the impact of systematic constraints on vulnerability and makes visible that vulnerability is socially constructed and context specific. The experience of vulnerability is not homogeneous , but is formulated as an outcome of interaction among multiple internal and external factors. Our research has brought to light the ripple effects of institutional vulnerability extended to economic, social, and emotional domains. The capture of these interconnected multiple dimensions reveals the complex nature of vulnerability and addresses a major weakness in the vulnerability literature that vulnerability is often viewed as a onedimensional construct .\n\nWhile there is an emerging scholarship on consumer constraints and vulnerability, studies focusing on the resilience consumers draw on in response to the constraints and vulnerability have only recently surfaced , leaving resilience as an under-researched and under-theorized area in marketing research. Our research empirically lands resilience within marketing literature and makes important contributions to its theory development. First, conventional models have treated resilience as an objective construct and ignored contexts where individuals experience vulnerability . Consequently, there is a lack of sufficient on alternative coping strategies among vulnerable consumers , indicating a static view on resilience as if it is attained through a law of disruption and reintegration . Our research extends this by taking a contextual view to examine how consumer resilience happens under complex institutional, economic, and social forces. It incorporates life situations into the discourse analysis and focuses on the context of systematic constraints, which has a significant impact on vulnerability and resilience attainment yet rarely studied. Our findings discover interpretation and adaptation as two key mechanisms driving the resilient pathways to wellbeing, indicating that resilience is learned and acquired in response to life situations. Our study, thus, provides much-needed empirical evidence to conceptualize resilience as a context-specific and individualized experience.\n\nSecond, though some works have examined how resilience might be constructed at different levels and within different contexts , our research is among the first in consumer research that formally describes resilience as a process to recover from adversity and delineates resilient pathways into progressive stages. The resilient pathways initiate with migrant workers' interpretation of their life situation and unfold with developing\ncoping attitudes and behaviors, leading to the achievement of sense of control over life, a key psychological need to be satisfied before obtaining higher life satisfaction. The findings present a panoramic view where resilient pathways develop and act as means that connect triggers of resilience, that is, systematic constraints and the subsequent vulnerability, and resilient qualities as an outcome, that is, life satisfaction. The process model that links contexts of life disruptions to processes and outcomes of resilience offers a useful framework for future resilience narratives to better capture the contextual input to the acquisition of resilience and its progressive building practice. Future studies can examine how the different skills, knowledges, and resources will shape different resilient pathways among vulnerable consumers.\n\nThird, our study addresses the issue of effectiveness of resilience from a long-term perspective and leads to a review and reconsideration of how to define resilience. Resilience has been mostly associated with positive adaptation, or active use of coping resources within vulnerable groups . The adaptation-focused definition of resilience has implicit implication of a surviving mindset with an emphasis on reacting to life disruptions and vulnerability. Our research shows that resilience could still be functional in achieving well-being with passive use of coping resources as protective factors, though it may turn into dysfunctionality in the long run without being used as developmental assets. Consumers facing systematic constraints and resource scarcity think less about the future effects of current behaviors . The practice of resilience to meet short-term needs and desires may not alleviate consumer vulnerability but instead, potentially provoking deeper vulnerability and weakened well-being eventually. These findings offer new insights of defining resilience as a dynamic concept and interpreting its functioning with a long-term perspective. The adaptationfocused surviving mindset in understanding resilience needs to be balanced with a growth mindset emphasizing on capability development to assess resilience when consumers deal with life stressors. Our research argues for a relatively new view of resilience that goes beyond adaptation to capability approach to examine long-term effects of resilience on vulnerability and well-being. Such a view facilitates the of resilience in a truly strength-related and empowerment-oriented paradigm.\n\nThis research renders significant implications to practitioners and policy makers. The most straightforward message is that raising incomes for migrants is not a guaranteed source of power nor a promising remedy to reduce vulnerability and increase well-being. Our findings indicate that feeling better off matters more than being better off among migrant workers. Spending and consumption are means to a desired and valued life, not ends. In this regard, simply opening up market access, offering more products and encouraging consumption from migrants without knowing sufficiently what migrants value in their migration life are not an effective and sustainable solution to build resilience and enhance their life satisfaction. In-depth analyses of the contextual factors that create vulnerability and its impact on consumers are essential for the constructive engagement from marketers and policy makers. More efforts should be invested in removing the causes of vulnerability and/or empowering vulnerable consumers to achieve a higher state of existence. For example, our research shows that social capital is a primary bridge for resource attainment, but due to the inward social networking approach, such social resources only bring limited benefits to migrant workers. Migrant workers utilize social capitals as congruent capitals for emotional bonding rather than competitive ones to bridge the gap of resources. Practitioners and policy makers need to consider more effective policy directives and marketing programs to provide migrant workers with the ability to pursue new opportunities through fostering a more socially enabling environment with intragroup bonding and intergroup bridging social capital . On another note, this\nresearch joins the call for researchers, practitioners and policy makers to take a broader view to understand and interpret vulnerability by including the concept of being capability poor. The problems and challenges posed by the systematic constraints are not simply economic inequality, but more significantly, the issue of inequality of capabilities. Disadvantaged populations in the society, such as migrant workers, need more support relevant to their capability building, not a short-term wealth building check. Marketers and policy makers should be more constructively engaged in solving the challenge of capability inequality to achieve the societal wellbeing."
