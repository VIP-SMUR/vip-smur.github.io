        "4": " \n\nResilience is positively linked to academic engagement and achievement, and contributes to students' mental health and wellbeing. Research was undertaken to measure the resilience of students undertaking studies in the built environment, identify the factors which contribute to high or low levels of student resilience and explore the relationship between resilience and wellbeing. Survey data were collected from  undergraduate students from Melbourne, Australia.  identified that of the six components of resilience, students scored highest on building networks, staying healthy, interacting cooperatively and living authentically, and lowest in maintaining perspective. Experience, university policy and the interaction between the university, work and home environments was found to contribute to student resilience.  also identified that resilience is an antecedent of student wellbeing. A conceptual model of resilience and student wellbeing is presented which draws on the ecological systems model. Universities can actively support student wellbeing by fostering resilience. Resilience can be developed by embedding resilience-building strategies within course structures, learning activities and assessment tasks. Universities can implement policies and procedures and offer assets and resources which create a learning environment that supports resilience-building behaviour.",

        "7": " \n\nUndertaking study at university poses specific challenges which must be overcome to enable students to survive and thrive. High school students transitioning to university are faced with an unfamiliar environment which can induce stress and poor mental wellbeing . An inability to adjust to this new environment can impact on students' academic success and persistence in post-secondary education . Another significant transition takes place when students move from university into the workplace to commence their professional practice. Resilience has been acknowledged as an important capability that can assist students in their transition to university  and into professional life . Resilience is described as the ability to bounce back or recover from stressful circumstances in order to reach a whole adjustment to environment . Importantly, resilience can also contribute to students' mental health and wellbeing , and has been positively linked to academic engagement and achievement .\n\nStudents undertaking studies in property and construction have very high levels of burnout compared to professional samples due to the pressures exerted from combining both work and university . Curtis and Williams  write of the \"routinisation\" of students combining paid work and study, suggesting that this is now the norm. Lingard  found that hours spent in paid employment were at least as long and, in many cases, were in excess of hours spent at university for property and construction students. Furthermore, construction is a high stress industry in which the professional workforce experiences burnout , job insecurity , work-life conflict  and poor health . Development of resilience is therefore positioned as an important capability which can be developed during university and be applied in both the university and work settings which are known to induce stress.",
        "8": " \n\nResilience is linked to critical outcomes for the student. These include academic engagement and achievement,\nand mental health and wellbeing. Despite an understanding of the built environment as highly pressured and stressful, together with an understanding that students who combine work and study experience a high level of burnout, there is a lack of research on student resilience in built environment education. This study aims to contribute to our understanding of student resilience in higher education, with a specific focus on the built environment disciplines. The research aims to  measure the resilience of students undertaking studies in the built environment;  identify the factors which contribute to high or low levels of student resilience; and  explore the relationship between resilience and wellbeing.",
        "9": " \n\nLearners are faced with significant levels of ongoing stress throughout the course of their university experience which impacts on their mental health . In Australia, a study of , undergraduates from two Australian universities reported \"preliminary evidence of very high levels of psychological distress\". Of the student population surveyed,  experienced elevated levels of distress. This level was significant when compared to the general population of which only \\% felt heightened levels of psychological distress . The United Kingdom Royal College of Psychiatrists  identified that \\% of students studying in higher education reported clinical levels of distress. Further, a study of United Kingdom undergraduate learners identified that stress and difficulties with mental health and wellbeing are widely experienced . Like other Western countries, American students have also demonstrated elevated levels of distress . The ability to manage stress is critical for students, as academic stress is associated with lower course grades, coping and motivation .\n\nEducators are tasked with the role of providing a supportive environment in which students can learn and prosper . There is growing recognition by educators that resilience development during university is an important capability that will increase the likelihood of positive academic and employment outcomes. This positions resilience as a key capability which can be developed through the university curriculum  by the implementation of targeted strategies which build assets and resources critical for resilience.",
        "10": " \n\nResilience has been linked to maintaining physical and psychological health, and having the ability to recover more quickly from stressful events . Windle  offers a comprehensive definition of resilience which emphasizes the centrality of assets and resources in responding to negative affect, recognizing that resilience is contextual and will vary over the life course:\n\nResilience is the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate this capacity for adaptation and 'bouncing back' in the face of adversity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary. \n\nPrevious research has typically investigated students' resilience within a specific programme, such as law , social work, nursing and midwifery , medicine and engineering , education and theology . Research on undergraduate student resilience has typically been fragmented and non-cumulative due to inconsistencies between conceptualizations of resilience. One conceptualization positions resilience as a dispositional trait linked to personality , while another positions resilience as a learned capability which is dynamic and contextual . A further critical limitation is the lack of consistency of scales applied to resilience-based research within a university setting. These include the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale , the My Resilience Scale , the Resilience Scale , the Dispositional Resilience Scale  and Gurgan's  Resilience Scale . Given the variation between measures, resilience prevalence across studies cannot be easily compared even if the study populations have shared characteristics.",
        "11": " \n\nResilience is contextual in nature and will vary over the life course ; therefore, it is possible that factors both inside and external to university will impact on students' resilience. For example, support networks from within and external to university are considered important for resilience . Furthermore, it is understood that individuals can develop resilience from being exposed to challenging and stressful situations in one system , and transfer these learning\nacross systems . While the focus of this study is on students within a university setting, the ecological model contends that systems do not exist independently. Rather, the systems in which the individual participates are fundamentally linked. The ecological model considers individual experience and behaviour from a systems approach . Each system contains roles, norms and rules which may shape behaviour, and experience is one system may influence the experience in another system. The ecological model incorporates various levels including the microsystem and the mesosystem. A mesosystem is the relationship between two microsystems. Students often participate in three microsystems including university, home and work, which interact to form three mesosystems:  university and home;  university and work; and  home and work. McLeroy et al.  applied the ecological model to frame the health behaviour of individuals, recognizing that behaviour is determined by five factors: intrapersonal factors, interpersonal processes and groups, institutional factors, community factors and public policy. McLeroy et al.  claim that the strength of the ecological model is that it focuses attention on the environmental causes of behaviour and identifies socially constructed environmental interventions. Resilience is considered as a skill that can be developed through carefully targeted initiatives . By applying this model, resilience development may be considered as an intervention which enables students to manage stress and adversity arising from the university microsystem and thereby promote student wellbeing.",
        "13": " \n\nA purposive sampling strategy was applied to the research. Students studying in the property, construction and project management disciplines at a university in Melbourne, Australia, were invited to participate in the research. Students completed the survey during class time as part of a wellbeing-related learning activity and were invited\nto submit their completed survey for inclusion in the research. Participation in the research was voluntary and all data were coded to ensure participant anonymity. Ethics approval for the research was received from the university ethics committee.",
        "14": " \n\nGiven that little is known about the resilience of students of the built environment, an exploratory approach was applied. This approach was warranted as exploratory research seeks to  become familiar with the basic facts, setting and concerns;  generate new ideas, conjectures or hypotheses; and  formulate and focus questions for future research . The framework used to address the three research aims is summarized in Table . Participants completed a survey which comprised of demographic information, a resilience measure and measures of mental health and wellbeing to gauge their prevalence and profile in the student sample. Mental health and wellbeing were measured by depression, anxiety and stress, and happiness scales. At the end of the survey, participants were invited to add comments about their own resilience in the form of open text.\n\nResilience: the Resilience at University  measure  has  items and six subscales:  finding your calling;  interacting cooperatively and living authentically;  managing stress;  building networks;  maintaining perspective; and  staying healthy. Examples of the items include \"The university work that I do fits well with my personal values and beliefs\", and \"I have a strong and reliable network of supportive students at university\". Instructions given to participants specified that the questions referred to their experience at university, including the time spent at university, as well as the time spent on studies outside of university. Participants were asked to indicate their agreement with the items on a seven-point Likert scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\" . The scale has demonstrated good internal reliability . The RAU was selected as  can be translated into practical curriculum-based\n\n\ninitiatives which support resilience development .\n\nDepression, anxiety and stress: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale  short version  is a -item self-report measure which yields three psychometrically separate factors  and has good internal reliability . The response format is a four-point Likert scale, with higher scores reflecting a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress. Each factor has seven items that are summed to compute a score.\n\nHappiness: the Subjective Happiness Scale  is a four-item self-report measure developed to assess an individual's overall happiness . The response format is a seven-point Likert scale, with higher scores reflecting greater happiness. A single score is computed by averaging the responses to the four items following reverse coding of the fourth item. Scores range from  to  , with higher scores reflecting greater happiness . The measure has demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency, with an alpha coefficient of . .\n\nIn the free text section of the survey, participants were invited to comment on issues relating to their own resilience. Thematic analysis was applied to the comments, and the data was independently analysed by two researchers who agreed on the emergent themes, thereby ensuring inter-rater reliability .",

Four hundred and ten surveys were completed, representing a  response rate.

Factor   and Factor   were predictor variables across all measures of wellbeing, while factor   was not a predictor variable across any measure of wellbeing.\n\nOf the  participants who completed the survey,   wrote comments. Five themes emerged from the qualitative data which related to  combining work and study;  the contextual nature of resilience;  building networks;  learning from and reflecting on past experience; and  study-life balance.\n\nFourth-year students reported feeling stressed due to combining work and study.\n\nOne fourth-year student commented:\nTreating my final year as the \"last push\", so working really hard with little break, but making the most of my time\nwith uni mates. The biggest stress is the pressure of work outside uni from the employer I work at.\nAnother fourth-year student referred to the challenge of juggling work and university activities: \"I am a dedicated student that tries to get the best possible  from my abilities. It's been difficult juggling work and uni at the same time\". Similarly, another fourth-year student explained the pressure she experienced: \"Managing both uni and work is difficult for me, which affects me greatly\". Another fourth-year student commented on the stress he was experiencing due to work and university demands: \"I am generally happy, however now I have a new job I am experiencing higher levels of stress and unhappiness than previously in my life\". The frequency of students combining work and study was high for both first-year  and fourth-year students . Fourthyear students worked longer hours per week  than first-year students . Sixty-three \\% of fourth-year students worked  or more hours per week compared to only  of first years. This may be one of the reasons why first-year students did not raise the issue of combining work and university as a potential source of stress.\n\nStudents identified the contextual nature of resilience and recognized that specific events both internal and external to university can impact on the level of resilience. For example, one fourth-year student reported feeling stressed when he did not obtain the graduate role he had applied for, which had impacted on his level of resilience:\n\nI feel my overall resilience score is lower than it would normally be. A few days before this survey I was informed that I was not going to be offered a graduate job I had been chasing. Having made the final round of interviews and then just missing out was a bitter pill to swallow and my  in this survey reflect this.\nAnother fourth-year student identified that moving house had been a stressful experience that had influenced her response to survey items: \"Survey answers could be distorted depending on what was going on in the respondent's mind in the last week. I moved house! In the week before that, the answers would have been quite different\". Another student explained that he was having an atypical week: \"This week has been rather stressful for me, which is unusual. I've felt more agitated, under pressure, have been sleeping less and exercising more often in order to reduce my stress levels\". While fourth-year students were able to recognize the contextual nature of resilience, this was not reflected in the first-year students' comments.\n\nBuilding networks and having a supportive network were experienced differently by first- and fourth-year students. The transition into university from high school often meant developing a new support base, and this was identified by first-year students. For example, one first-year\nstudent commented: \"I found that I am a generally positive and happy person, however, I need to work on friendship building/networking\". Another first-year student found it difficult to develop networks due to the erratic nature of class attendance by other students:\n\nI believe the low score in networking is due to the volatility in attendance with regards to the students in the Construction Management program. Although you get to meet new people, due to this, it makes it difficult to create networks. You generally only keep in touch with people you work with .\nAnother student expressed his frustration at developing networks as he took class with multiple year levels:\n\nAs I came through a diploma program into a degree, a number of subjects were credited off my degree. This resulted in me undertaking subjects across as many as  year levels in one semester. It was very hard to stay grounded with my fellow students in those year levels when they were at different stages and maturities in their degrees. It was also hard to build relationships\nIn contrast to first-year students, fourth-year students had developed supportive networks with fellow students. This was considered important as it helped students to manage challenging situations and feelings of stress and anxiety. For example, one fourth-year student commented: \" strong network of friends has helped me commiserate if something annoys us or help each other if something challenges us\". Another fourth-year student commented: \"Not a lot of things stress me, after doing university for four years the assignments seems easy. The use of a strong university network allows everyone to do better\".\n\nLearning from and reflecting on past experience was acknowledged by fourth-year students as critical to adapt and succeed. For example, one student commented:\n\nI feel through the life experiences I have gone through, I am at a stage where I know myself well and know my capabilities and what I can achieve. Resilience is an important factor to have as crumbling under pressure is not considered a strength. So, I have learnt to become resilient.\n\nSimilarly, another fourth-year student acknowledged the role of experience in developing resilience: \"It may be my personal experiences that have determined my resilience abilities\". A fourth-year international student reflected on his difficult experience as a first-year student, and how he had adapted to the challenges he faced while studying in a foreign country:\n\nI feel international students, who have never been out of their home state let alone continent can sometimes find it hard to study many years abroad. To study abroad  can be viewed as a great opportunity \"back home\", but the day to day experience can be far from enjoyable. I experienced \"a lot\" of stress in my first few years. Now I feel somewhat acquainted after going through practice to correct my accent, be aware\nof my state. Basically, it is a huge emotional burden and responsibility of losing your entitlement with friends and family for such prolonged periods. Once you ground your values/identity as you mature, you feel more comfortable being away from your local friends and family.\nHaving the ability to balance study with other parts of their life was considered crucial for success at university. For example, one student commented:\n\nOver time I have learnt to compartmentalize study from life. Obviously both regularly overlap, but I have found my own way of getting consistent marks from working at a high level and remaining happy. It has probably taken me a while to get to a state when I feel comfortable at University. I used to get frustrated which made me distance myself from study, resulting in poor marks.\nSimilarly, another student commented:\"I don't let uni take up all of my time/energy, and I have lots of others things to do outside of uni\". In contrast, another student explained how his challenge with balancing study and personal life had led to feelings of stress:\n\nIn terms of managing stress, this is time. I do have a problem with it, and I've been trying to implement solutions to offset the amount of stress I am taking on. It is not that I'm not careful to ensure my uni work does not dominate my personal life, it's just that I allow my personal life to dominate my uni work - leading me to never actually get it done, and this builds up my anxiety over my  and end of semester GPA .\nAnother fourth-year student explained how her emotional state impacted on all parts of her life: \"I feel like the emotional state does affect my daily life and performance. Hence, it is important to take care of ourselves and stay positive\". In contrast to other students, one mature aged fourth-year student described how life experience had put university into perspective: \"I'm mature aged and  a strong history of depression. My concerns relating to uni are mostly insignificant when compared to my life experiences\".",
        "19": "\n\nTo address the first aim of the research, the resilience of students undertaking studies in the built environment was measured. Of the six components of resilience, students scored highest on building networks, staying healthy, interacting cooperatively and living authentically. The students' lowest score was in maintaining perspective. Maintaining perspective is considered an important individual asset related to resilience , and is described as having the ability to reframe setbacks, maintain a solution-focus and manage negativity . Maintaining perspective plays a critical role in the translation from student experience to student learning. Maintaining perspective is critical\nfor receiving and learning from constructive feedback from peers and educators. Poulos and Mahony  contend that \"how the student interprets and deals with feedback is critical to the success of formative assessment and involves both psychological state and disposition\". An inability to reframe challenging experiences as learning opportunities may inhibit students' learning capacity. Maintaining perspective also emerged as a predictor of wellbeing.  identified that there were no differences between first- and fourth-year students for maintaining perspective. This is an interesting finding, given that resilience is considered to improve with experience . Given the low score and lack of capability development between first- and fourthyear students, maintaining perspective is one area where educators of the built environment could prioritize. This can developed through curriculum which identifies the complexity associated with discipline or professional practice, and the development of specific activities that allow students to experience situated complexity through activities such as role-plays and re-framing. Importantly, educators must be adequately supported by their university to facilitate such interventions which promote student resilience and support wellbeing. In the university environment, learning and teaching advisors may play a key support role in preparing educators to successfully implement resilience-building strategies.\n\nTo address the second aim of the research, the factors which contribute to high or low levels of student resilience were identified. Learning from past experience was identified as a key factor of resilience, which is consistent with resilience definitions . Fourth-year students had significantly higher levels for interacting cooperatively and living authentically, managing stress and building networks when compared with first-year students. Fourth-year students acknowledged that stressful situations related to their university studies in previous years had enabled them to grow and develop their resilience capability. In contrast, first-year students had limited experience from which to draw on when faced with challenging and stressful experiences related to their university studies. This is consistent with previous studies which identify that students transitioning into university are faced with an unfamiliar environment which can induce stress . Given new students' limited experience of managing stress in the university setting, educators may usefully support the development of resilience of first-year students by equipping them with stress management knowledge and strategies . This may be achieved through the inclusion of information into orientation\nprogrammes and first-year curricula. The availability of student resources offered by the university such as academic skills development, mentoring and counselling may also enable students to gain knowledge which supports the development of effective stress management strategies .\n\nA further factor which contributed to student resilience was the university itself. Findings suggest that the university environment can influence resilience development through policies and procedures which may act to support or hinder resilience-building behaviour of students. First-year students identified that developing new support networks with fellow students was a challenge. One of the reasons cited for this was the erratic nature of class attendance. As some students did not attend class on a regular basis, developing support networks with fellow students was difficult. This behaviour was underpinned by the sample university's policy which specified that class attendance was not mandatory, and students should not be disadvantaged for non-attendance. This individual-environment interaction and its associated behaviour are consistent with the ecological systems model . Using this model, McLeroy et al.  identified that universities are organizational settings which can influence health-related behaviours of individuals through the structures and policies they put in place. In this study, non-mandatory class attendance had directly impacted on students' ability to develop and maintain support networks. Strong support networks are an integral component of resilience capability , and universities can assist students to develop these important social networks by creating an environment which encourages students to connect with their fellow students. This may be achieved through in-class learning and teaching strategies which focus on group learning activities and assessments as well as exercises from resilience-building compendiums . In addition, educators can encourage students to participate in activities outside the formal learning environment through clubs, interest groups and social functions .\n\nThe ecological model considers that the systems in which an individual participates are fundamentally linked, and that experience is influenced by participation in multiple systems . Students acknowledged that friends and family outside of university formed an integral part of their social network, which is consistent with the findings of Morosanu et al. . These social networks contributed to students' resilience. This suggests there is a reciprocal relationship between systems, whereby support in one system\n is used to manage stress originating from another system . Another sys-tem-to-system relationship emerged from the . Students identified that challenging and stressful situations experienced outside of university  could negatively impact on their level of resilience at university. Findings suggest that participation in multiple systems may be a factor which contributes to higher or lower levels of student resilience, and this was observed in the sample whereby fourth-year students participated in university and worked an average of . h per week. These students reported having lower resilience and experiencing high levels of stress due to the pressure of undertaking both university and work demands. In contrast, first-year students also studied and worked; however, their average working week was lower at . h and they did not report any stress as a result of combining work and study. These findings support the notion that resilience is contextual and will vary over the life course depending on the individual's life circumstances .\n\nThe third aim of the research explored the relationship between resilience and wellbeing. In this study, wellbeing was considered using measures of subjective happiness, depression, anxiety and stress.  identified a resil-ience-to-wellbeing relationship. Resilience was shown to have a positive relationship with subjective happiness, and a negative relationship with depression, anxiety and stress. Five of the six components of resilience  had a negative relationship with depression; building networks, maintaining perspective and staying healthy had a negative relationship with anxiety; maintaining perspective and staying healthy had a\nnegative relationship with stress; interacting cooperatively and living authentically, maintaining perspective and staying healthy had a positive relationship with subjective happiness. Figure  outlines a new conceptual model of resilience and student wellbeing which frames the study's findings in terms of the ecological model . Windle's  definition of resilience is applied to the conceptual model which emphasizes that assets and resources within the individual, their life and environment facilitate the capacity for adaptation and bouncing back in the face of adversity. In the first stage of the model, a student's resilience capability is developed from the assets and resources they access in the multiple systems in which they participate, such as university, work and home. The home microsystem is inclusive of environments in which the student participates beyond university and work and includes family, sports and leisure. In the university environment, resilience-building assets and resources are inclusive of learning and teaching strategies , university policies and processes which shape the learning environment , and services offered by the university such as mentoring programmes, counselling services, interest and sporting groups . In the work and home systems, students may access assets and resources such as support networks  which contribute to resilience development. When students are faced with challenging and stressful situations and events related to their academic studies, they can draw on their resilience capability to actively manage the stressful situation. In the conceptual model, student resilience is positioned as an antecedent to student wellbeing.\n\nFigure . Conceptual model of student resilience and wellbeing.",
        "20": " \n\nThe development of resilience for students of the built environment is critical for two reasons. Firstly, resilience has been positively linked to academic persistence, engagement and achievement. Secondly, the construction industry is known as a high-stress environment in which its workers suffer from poor mental health. In order to be work-ready, built environment graduates require the capacity to bounce back and recover from stressful circumstances. Through this research, a third reason has emerged.  identified that resilience is an antecedent of student wellbeing. The research identified a resilience profile for students of the built environment. Of the six components of resilience, students scored highest on building networks, staying healthy, interacting cooperatively and living authentically, and lowest in maintaining perspective. An ecological systems model was applied to the findings to interpret the relationship between the university, work and home environments and how they contribute to the development of student resilience. Emerging from this, a conceptual model of student resilience and wellbeing was developed. The research has practical implications for educators within the built environment. Universities can actively support student wellbeing by fostering resilience. It is possible that resilience can be developed by identifying specific areas such as an ability to maintain perspective that can be embedded within course structures, learning activities and assessment tasks. Furthermore, universities can create and shape the learning environment through the implementation of policies and practices and assets and resources which support resilience-building behaviours.\n\nThe research is limited in three ways. Firstly, the RAU was used to measure student resilience therefore findings are not able to be contrasted with other studies of student resilience which have used different measures. It is unknown whether the findings of this research are particular to students of the built environment, or whether they are reflective of the general undergraduate population in universities. Secondly, the  cannot be generalized to other built environment programmes as the study was undertaken in one university in Australia. Finally, a cross-sectional survey was administered and therefore causal relationships are unable to be identified. However, in other literatures, for example, developmental psychology and psychiatry, the causal relationship of resilience-to-well-being has been well established .\n\nIn order to address limitations of generalizability, future research could explore the resilience of students undertaking studies in the built environment across multiple universities. Broadening the sample to other disciplines would enable a comparative analysis which will assist in\nestablishing whether the resilience profile of students of the built environment is different to other disciplines or not. Further development of the conceptual model of student resilience and wellbeing may usefully identify the stressors originating from the university environment. Future research may also focus on the implementation and evaluation of teaching and learning strategies which seek to develop student resilience."
