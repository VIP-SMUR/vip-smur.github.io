        "1": " Impact of Perception of Green Space for Health Promotion on Willingness to Use Parks and Actual Use among Young Urban Residents ",
        "2": " \n\nPromoting the use of green space is a fundamental way to improve physical and mental health and to enhance the quality of life of urban residents. In response to increasing demand for green space in cities, the impact of perception of green space for health promotion on willingness to use parks and actual use among young urban residents was investigated in this study. A total of  young residents  in three cities in China were surveyed by online questionnaire. A group of multiple regression models was constructed to investigate the influencing perception factors of participants' willingness to use parks and actual use. The  revealed that the young residents' perception of green space components for health promotion  had a greater effect on their willingness to use parks and to promote health, while it was less influential with respect to their actual park use behavior . Among these variables, green space access is a critical concern for willingness to use toward parks. The disparities of perception of green space for health promotion effect on willingness to use a park and actual use provide a better understanding of the psychological factors affecting park use among young residents. The findings also provided some implications for public health policymakers, urban planners and landscape architects in designing parks to encourage visitation by young people.\n\n\n green space; health promotion; park use; young urban residents",
        "3": " . \n\nAs urbanization and populations rapidly increase, maintaining livable and healthy cities has become a great challenge around the world . The inactive urban lifestyle is thought to be associated with increases in hypertension , diabetes , obesity  and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety . It has been suggested that today's younger generations are less healthy and more likely to suffer from chronic diseases than their predecessors . In China, urban environments have led to changes in lifestyles that increase the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases . To address urban-related health problems, various preventative measures have been proposed in urban environments . Providing urban green spaces has become one of the important measures to\npromote physical activity and enhance human well-being, which has aroused wide interest among researchers and policymakers .\n\nGreen spaces such as urban parks are a useful environmental source for urban dwellers to improve physical, mental and social health . For example, interactions with urban parks can encourage physical activity, thereby reducing heart disease, type II diabetes and obesity and thus improving the physical health of people . Natural landscapes in urban parks reduce mental fatigue and help people find relief from their stressful daily routines, as well as improve cognitive capacity . Furthermore, urban parks provide a variety of opportunities for people to participate in public activities and thus promote social interaction .\n\nDespite the health benefits associated with urban park visitation, recent studies have shown that parks are generally underutilized among young people . To date, most of the empirical studies on the associations between park usage and health outcomes for young people have been focused on Western countries in urban contexts . However, it is difficult to compare these relationships observed in other countries to the Chinese population. First, the differences in park physical features between cities in China and other countries could result in different relationships with park usage among residents . Second, a large amount of evidence shows that people from different ethnic and cultural s and ages vary in the ways they use green spaces and in their perceptions of the beneficial effects of parks . Consequently, it is necessary to understand these relationships in a Chinese context.\n\nAlthough the literature concerning the factors affecting park usage is accumulating in China, most studies focus on the objective environment attributes, such as park pathways , quality of greenery  and accessibility . Studies examining the psychological mechanism of built environments on individual's park use behavior are still insufficient. A few studies suggest that peoples' perception of the environment could influence willingness and intention toward their surroundings, which may stimulate actual behavior . Relatively fewer studies pay attention to the effects of perception of green space for health promotion on resident willingness to use parks. Furthermore, as cities usually with higher living standards, many large cities in China have attracted large population of young residents that are facing more pressures than their predecessors , and the health status of this group has become a great social challenge . However, existing studies related to the association between psychological factors and park usage for young urban residents remain relatively deficient in Chinese society. This is important because encouraging park visitation could promote the physical health and mental health of young residents .\n\nAiming to address the above knowledge gaps, the associations among young urban residents' perception of green space for health promotion, willingness to use parks and actual behavior in three cities in China were investigated. Young urban residents age ranging from  to  years were selected according to the definition of young residents from previous research and China's medium and long term youth development plan  . In addition, owing to the recent changes in the role of traditional parks, new and more accessible forms of green space have been gaining more attention among urban residents. Therefore, green spaces such as roof gardens, green lane and greenery associated with housing estates were added into the broader context of parks in our study. Based on the study , several suggestions for Future Park planning and design to encourage visitation by urban young residents are proposed herein.",
        "5": " ..\n\nPerceived benefit relates to an individual's perception of the positive changes that are brought by specific behavior, which, in turn, influences the attitude of a person toward their external environment . Additionally, according to the theory of planned behavior , willingness is\naffected by attitude, i.e., if a person's attitude toward a certain behavior is more positive, the person then has a stronger willingness to exhibit that behavior .\n\nMany studies have demonstrated the roles of perception in contributing to behavioral intention towards green space . For example, . showed that the perception of benefits of green space is closely associated with the willingness of residents to conserve green space . Perceptions of the contribution of small green spaces in reducing air pollution had a positive impact on residents' willingness to pay for maintaining roof gardens and green lanes . Furthermore, some studies have noted that awareness of the benefits that green space provide may increase the willingness of the people to use green space . The presence of water features in a park could afford relaxed feelings and reduces stress; hence, people would have a positive attitude toward the park, ultimately enhancing their willingness to visit parks . Additional studies in Western countries also suggest that the perceptions of greenness density, biodiversity, presence of old trees, comfort, cleanliness and order could indirectly influence an individual's intention to use parks . For example, perceived amount of vegetation could promote use of space and contribute to the fostering of social activities . Perception of park cleanliness and order have also been found to be strongly related with frequency of visitation . However, a negative perception of the green space may contribute to a negative willingness to use it. The perception of fear or insecurity in a park could provoke a psychological barrier that makes people avoid the park . To some extent, such an insecure feeling has an adverse impact on attitudes toward the willingness to use parks . In addition, evidence indicates that differences exist between Chinese and Western attitudes towards urban parks and green spaces, e.g., park usage pattern and outdoor recreation characteristics . Therefore, it is likely that differences between Western and Chinese young urban residents influence the perception of benefits of park use, which in turn vary in promoting their willingness towards park use for improving health.",
        "6": " .. \n\nDuring the past several decades, many studies have been conducted by scholars to explore factors that affect the interactions between people and urban green space. Structural factors, such as size and proximity, have demonstrated associations with park use . For example, . found that increase in parkland size was associated with an increase in the frequency of park visitation through a study of  neighborhood parks across the United States . Other studies suggested that accessibility is an essential precondition for park use , as increased in distance from a park likely leads to a decline in the park visitation . Park physical features may also play a vital role in encouraging park use or physical activity among residents , especially for specific features, e.g., playgrounds , water features  and vegetation . In contrast, other features, such as litter, vandalism and poor playground surface quality have been shown to have a negative impact on park use .\n\nIn addition to physical factors, numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of psychological factors on the park use. For example, . found that higher-quality perception of a park had a positive influence on park visitation among young people . Some studies also showed that an individual's nature orientation or attitude towards nature was the more important factor explaining urban dwellers' actual park visitation . Perceived vegetation quality and provision of facilities also encourage park visitation of residents, which in turn may improve mental, physical and social health . Moreover, it was suggested that perceived accessibility was more important than a physical distance in determining park use behavior . In view of the above, the roles of both physical and psychological factors in influencing park visitation are relatively well investigated, yet very little is known about the associations between young residents' perception of green space for health promotion and their actual park use behavior.\n\nBased on the literature review above, the theoretical framework in Figure  is proposed. Figure depicts how the perception of green space for health promotion affects willingness to use and actual use toward parks among urban young residents, in order to answer the following questions:\n\nFigure . Potential relationships among perception of green space for health promotion, willingness to use parks and actual park use behavior among young urban residents.\n Did the young residents' perceptions of green space for health promotion shape their willingness to use park to promote health?\n Did this perception affect their park use behavior?\n Which factors of the perception of green space for health promotion were strongly associated with park use willingness and actual behavior?\n\nThe answers to these questions are important because they could increase our understanding of factors that contribute to the promotion of park use. Thus, urban policymakers could understand how to design and manage urban parks, which would effectively increase residents' willingness to use parks, promote actual park use behavior and improve the health of young urban residents.",
        "8": " .. \n\nThis study was designed to improve understanding of the effect of young urban residents' perceptions of green space components for health promotion on their park use willingness and behavior in Chinese cities. To achieve the objectives, an online questionnaire survey was conducted in three typical cities, i.e., Beijing, Xi'an and Guangzhou.\n\nBeijing, Xi'an and Guangzhou are in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Guanzhong Plain region and Pearl River Delta, respectively . The three cities offer important sites with which to investigate the impact of perception of green space for health promotion on willingness to use parks and actual use among young urban residents because of their demographics and green space distribution. Beijing, the capital of China, is the country's political, cultural and economic center of China. By the end of , Beijing had . million permanent residents . The city occupied a total area of  and had  of green space and its official ratio of park green space was  per capita . The overall number and area of urban parks in Beijing has increased year-by-year. By , the number of registered parks in Beijing has grown to more than , including Chaoyang district, Haidian district and Fengtai districts, which cover a large area . Located in a river valley, Xi'an lies north of the Weihe River and south of the Qinling Mountains. Xi'an is an important megalopolis and a crucial scientific, educational and industrial base of Central China. As the capital of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an includes an area of  and has a population of approximately  million. The urban green coverage of Xi'an reached  with  urban parks and a per capita park green space of  by the end of  . Guangzhou is an important central city, international business center and comprehensive transportation hub of South China. As the capital of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou is a megacity with a population of nearly  million in . It has a large percentage of urban green spaces with approximately  parks in the inner and outer suburbs, and the park green space per capita has reached  . With similar green coverage rates, diverse types of green spaces, populations and economic statuses, Beijing, Xi'an and Guangzhou are typical representatives\nof socioeconomic centers with the conditions to attract and retain youth in China, representing North, Central and South China . Therefore, the sample data from these areas may mirror the willingness to use parks to promote health, park use behaviors and the components concerning perceptions of green space among young urban residents in China.\n\nFigure . Locations selected for conducting the questionnaire.\nBy March , China had  million Internet users, among which about  were young people aged from  to  years old . Therefore, an online questionnaire survey was a better choice for young urban residents that were more likely to have good access to the Internet than other age groups. The questionnaires on the Wenjuanxing website , one of the most frequently used online data-collection platforms in China. Invitations were sent to potential subjects and responses solicited through social media and email from October  to November . Participants were informed that the eligible age for this study was between  years old and  years old , and participants must have lived in that city for at least six months. Respondents were reassured in advance that all identifying information would be kept anonymous and that the information was for noncommercial use. Finally, a total of  online questionnaires were collected. The returned questionnaires had the quality criteria of all the questions being completed and verifiable demographic information being provided. Of all the collected questionnaires,  were invalid due to incompletion or being ineligible. Thus, the valid sample consisted of  respondents, with an overall valid-response rate of  .",
        "9": " .. \n\nA web-based questionnaire containing  questions in total was designed for data collection following an extensive literature review. It was divided into three subsections:  respondents'\nwillingness to use parks to promote health and actual park use behavior,  perception of green space components for health promotion and  demographic information. The first section was designed to capture the data for the dependent variables, including the willingness to use parks to promote health  and park use behavior . The second section included questions designed to gather participants' perceptions about green space components for health promotion . The third section was set to collect demographic information , including the city of residence, age, sex, education, monthly income and type of residence. It took approximately  to  min for each respondent to complete the questionnaire.",
        "10": " ...  \n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, \"health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity .\" Thus, the respondents' willingness to use parks to promote health consisted of three categories, i.e., physical, mental and social health. These categories represent different dimensions of individual health that people would be willing to promote by going to green spaces. Physical health described the ability to protect and restore an organism  from the changing circumstances of an external environment . mental health was defined as the capacity to deal with, recover from and prevent psychological stress , as well as recognize one's own intellectual and emotional potential . Social health could be operationalized in terms of social support, referring to the ability to harbor good interpersonal relationships and social adaptation  . The study was used to investigate respondents' willingness of park use to promote health by asking \"Would you like to go to parks to improve your physical/mental/social health?\" A five-point scale  was implemented for the analysis to create the willingness index for health benefits.\n\nFrequency and duration of the park visits were used to measure park use behavior. Frequency and the duration of park visits have been widely applied in studies of the relationship between green space and health . The frequency of park visits was assessed by asking, \"How often do you visit urban parks or other green spaces?\" The response options for the first question were on a seven-point scale . The duration of park visits was measured by asking, \"How long on average do you stay in your most frequently used parks?\" The response options for the second question were on a five-point scale $.",
        "11": " ... \n\nThe perceptions of green space components for health promotion included the perception of green space attributes , landscape characteristics  and facilities . Three categories of green space components were adopted from previous studies . For the green space attributes, participants were asked whether green space access , type  or size  played a role in respondents' health promotion. The landscape characteristics were measured by asking whether plants , water , sensory features  or microclimate environments  contributed to health promotion. The facilities were assessed by asking respondents whether rest facilities  or amenity facilities  had an impact on their health promotion. All the response options were listed on a Likert scale .",

Finally, to further understand the influencing perception factors of young residents' willingness to use parks for health promotion and their park use behavior, a set of multiple regression models was built. Additionally, collinearity statistics were applied to check multicollinearity issues if there were moderate to strong correlations between the independent variables. All independent variables fell within an acceptable level of the variance inflation factor  ratio , implying that the concerns regarding multicollinearity were eliminated .",

        "20": " .. \n\nThe research reported in this article was intended to examine the impact of perception of green space components for health promotion on willingness to use parks and actual use among young residents in Chinese cities. Overall, the  revealed that young residents' perception of green space components for health promotion had a greater effect on their willingness to use parks to promote health. In contrast, young peoples' perceptions of green space components for health promotion were less influential on their actual park use behavior. The findings in this study provided a greater understanding of how the perception of parks for health promotion affected park use among young urban residents.\n\nThe park use willingness models that were examined in this study were moderately strong and the young residents' perceptive assessments of eight specific green space components for health promotion were found to be positive predictors, including green space access, type, size, plants, water, sensory features, microclimate environments and amenity facilities. Notably, the perception of green space attributes for health promotion, including the green space access, type and size, had a positive effect on the intention to use parks for all three dimensions of health effects. This finding indicated that young residents that knew these three attributes of green space were crucial factors that would contribute to well-being were more willing to use parks to achieve physical, mental and social health. Moreover, the perception of \"green space access\" was the most robust predictor for park use willingness in this research. This may have been largely attributed to the reason that having access to green space was a prerequisite for health promotion realization, making it a more remarkable predictor . The above findings were similar to those of previous studies, indicating that park utilization and future visitation intention related to health was positively determined by perceived accessibility . Likewise, some research studies found that the type and size of green space were correlated with different park benefits, activities and park use . For example, . reported that an individual's perception of park accessibility was a determinant of park use decisions .. suggested that neighborhood parks were associated with psychological benefits, while community\nparks and natural parks were related to social benefits and environmental benefits, respectively . Moreover, large green spaces tend to have more natural elements, recreational facilities and walking paths , which may offer more attractiveness and opportunities for various activities. Therefore, the health values and intentions that residents held for park use may have been related to these properties, which may partly explain the  in this study.\n\nWith respect to the perception of landscape characteristics for health promotion, there were three interesting findings. First, both the \"plants\" and \"microclimate environments\" variables were positive predictors of the willingness to use parks to promote mental health, suggesting that young residents could be more willing to visit parks to achieve psychological recovery if they believed that plants and microclimate environments played an important role in promoting health. The effect of plants on mental health has been widely recognized, and it has also been found to be a driving and attractive factor for the motivation to visit parks . It has also been reported that planting influences microclimate environments and may lead to great well-being, relaxation and comfort , which possibly provokes higher intentions to visit parks. Second, the perception of water was associated with the willingness to use parks for social health. This result provided support for the established evidence that one of the main benefits people identified receiving from blue space visits was social interaction . Additionally, the residents who had a better understanding of the importance of sensory features for health promotion reported a higher level of willingness to use parks for physical and mental health. Our research on the perception-willingness models may further expand the previous findings, which indicated that sensory perception was linked to health-related behaviors and mental restoration .\n\nWith respect to the perception of facilities for health promotion, the \"amenity facilities\" variable showed a significant impact on the willingness to use parks to promote physical health. The important role of amenity facilities in park use has been demonstrated in previous research, which may also explain the relationship found in this study .\n\nHowever, the park use behavior models had weak and mixed . It was found that the young residents' perception of green space components for health promotion could not predict the frequency and duration of park visits. The  of this research also showed that most of the young residents reported relatively high awareness of the role of green space components for health promotion. They also showed high intensions to visit parks to promote health, especially mental health. However, most respondents tended to visit parks at low frequency, and they spent less of their time visiting parks. This was consistent with previous research studies that showed that parks were generally underutilized by young people .\n\nThe more noteworthy findings of this research were the disparities between young residents' park use willingness and their use behavior. The  may have been partly explained by the following reasons. It was previously reported that young Chinese residents aged - were less likely to visit parks for leisure in their daily life because they preferred to pursue more active and exciting activities, such as visiting pubs and exploring wild areas . Some potential barriers may influence young people's actual park use behavior, such as less leisure time due to being busy with work and study . Furthermore, insufficient availability of green space due to governmental and social failures or accessible barriers  may have an impact on the residents' willingness and usage of green spaces . In addition, according to previous research, young people spend most of their leisure on the Internet, rather than outdoor activities . Moreover, the planning and design of urban parks in China have mainly focused on the recreational, esthetic and environmental effects, which may lack attractiveness for young residents.\n\nHowever, our findings were different with some studies in the Western countries. First, unlike Chinese young adults, residents in western countries tend to visit green spaces more frequently. For example, a nationwide study in Denmark suggested that  of the adult Danes visit green space every day and  of them visit green space at least once per week . This could be partly explained by the fact that many green spaces in Europe and America contained more physically\nchallenging facilities that could encourage young people to visit green spaces, such as skateparks, climbing frames, running tracks, fitness rings,, etc. . Conversely, there were fewer sports theme parks that could provide appropriate activities for young people in China . Second, western people prefer to walk dogs, do ball sports, jog or enjoy the sunshine in green spaces . However, young Chinese people seldom go to green spaces for activities, and they may think that green spaces are somewhere occupied by older people and children. Finally, compared to Western countries, the development of urban parks in China got off a late start. The residents of most Western countries have paid more attention to community parks and informal green spaces in recent years , while the priority of the planning and management were still large urban parks in Chinese green space departments, which may limit the usage of green space among young people.",
        "21": " ..  \n\nThis study generated knowledge that young residents' perceptions were an important factor significantly affecting the willingness to use parks to promote health. The findings in our research fit into a broader picture of effects to facilitate park use for health promotion and the findings provide some implications for green space design. The significant perceptive predictors of the willingness to use parks to promote health could be incorporated more appropriately into the design of green space. For example, access to green space was found to be a crucial factor affecting park use. Thus, it is recommended that urban planners improve the physical and perceived accessibility of green spaces. Intervention strategies were suggested, such as making green spaces of different sizes and functions that would be reasonably distributed in the city scales and providing information about different routes to access parks for young residents . Green space designers and managers also must pay more attention to other predictors, including plants, water, sensory features, microclimate environments and amenity facilities.\n\nThe findings in our study suggest that improving the above features may lead to higher willingness to use parks among young residents. However, young residents reported that they seldom visited parks in practice, which may imply that their willingness to use parks did not reflect their actual visitation behavior. Thus, our findings called attention to resurrecting outdoor activities for young residents. Because the way that young people perceive and use parks could be shaped by their values and interests , local policymakers should consider organizing natural programs that could cater to young residents' orientations, which may ultimately lead to remodeling their health-related behavior .",
        "22": " .. \nSome potential limitations of this study are worth mentioning. First, only a single point in time was examined in this study and cause and effect could not be differentiated from a cross-sectional nature. For instance, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics may have affected the relationship between the inferred reasons and outcomes . Therefore, we should use longitudinal studies that involve taking multiple measures over an extended period should be used in further research. Second, this study only depended on perceived measures instead of objective measures. The perception of green space components for health promotion was entirely based on the participants' subjective assessment. Thus, the answers may have differed from actual  because of mental deviation from subjective perception. A previous study applied objective measures to assess associations between experiences with natural environments and mental health . Similarly, a set of measures including, but not restricted to testing the biologically active components and the physical environments were used to deal with the biases. In this way, what factors that have specific health effects on young people could be further explored. Third, samples in the study mainly came from urban areas with relatively small populations. Most of the sample population were young residents with Internet access, while other young people with Internet difficulties were not included. Although the study adopted a convenient online questionnaire, it could also limit the generalizability and create a bias for the real\n. Consequently, a combination of various forms of investigation such as interviews, field surveys and observations, should be applied in the future. Finally, the reasons for the differences between willingness to use parks and actual park use behavior among young residents in this study are still unclear. Although young people may be busy and prefer more attractive activities, in the future, it will be necessary to investigate the mechanism behind these differences and what features would encourage young residents to visit parks.",
        "23": " . \n\nOwing to the growing disconnection between young residents and nature, in this study targeted young urban residents in China were targeted as respondents. The impact of the perception of green space for health promotion on park use willingness and behavior among young urban residents was explored. Overall, our findings demonstrated that young residents' perception of green space components for health promotion had a greater effect on their willingness to use parks to promote health and the perception of access to green space access was the most robust predictor of willingness. In contrast, the effect of young people's perception of green space components for health promotion was less influential on their actual park use behavior. Such disparities between park use willingness and actual use need more effort to facilitate actual park use behavior for health promotion among young residents. The findings also provided some implications for public health policymakers, urban planners and landscape architects in terms of the planning and design of green spaces oriented toward young people."
