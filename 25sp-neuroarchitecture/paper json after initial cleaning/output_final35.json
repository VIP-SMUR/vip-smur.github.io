        "3": " \n\nAlthough housing tenure mix policy has been widely used in improving the quality of life for low-income populations, it is inconclusive whether it can deliver any mental health benefits for residents. This study explores the implications of housing tenure mix on residents' mental health through investigating the intermediatory roles of the perception of neighborhood environment and sense of place. With  samples from six representative neighborhoods in Guangzhou, we constructed path analysis to test three potential mechanisms: the socioeconomic mechanism, the environment mechanism, and the person-place transactional mechanism. The  revealed that housing tenure mix level was significantly associated with neighborhood socioeconomic attributes and the perception of neighborhood environment, which shaped the sense of place. Dual mental health effects of housing tenure mix were identified: on the one hand, housing tenure mix resulted in income differentiation at the neighborhood level, which impeded individual mental functioning; on the other hand, the housing tenure mix protected residents' internal well-being via improving the perceived social cohesion and providing a nurturing ground for a sense of place. Different mechanisms function simultaneously on the associations of housing tenure mix with mental health, which should be carefully referred to during the decision-making of public housing development.",

        "5": " \n\nHousing is a key social determinant of health, and housing policy is regarded as an important intervention in the provision of healthy living environments . An inadequate amount of affordable housing increased residential segregation, and social exclusion are negatively associated with citizen health, which has become a challenge for healthy urbanization. Focusing on a mixture of different household types or tenure types , mixed communities have been implemented as a universal policy intervention to promote socially sustainable community and to reduce health inequality across various neighborhoods . In public housing practices worldwide, there has been an increasing trend in mixed tenures considering that housing differentiation and social exclusion produce an unequal distribution of health-damaging experiences . Some studies suggest that mixed communities improve physical conditions and provide social mingling opportunities for all residents. However, it is debatable whether it can protect citizens from potential health threats and contribute to public health . In a Western context , researchers found little support for the positive effect of housing tenure mix on the social This article has been corrected with minor changes. These changes do not impact the academic content of the article.\n      Urban Affairs Association\nwell-being of an area's population , raising questions ands on the efficacy of housing tenure mix as an intervention for improving public health.\n\nIn China, to combat social crises derived from increased housing unaffordability and the differentiation accompanied by the housing market transition, the central government has launched a housing tenure mix policy to stabilize housing prices and ensure social stability . In response to the  economic crisis, the central government launched a series of public housing initiatives, such as the commitment to constructing . million units and  million units of public housing during the \"th Five Year Plan\" period  and the \"th Five Year Plan\" period , where housing tenure mix intervention contributed to achieving these development goals . Operationally, housing tenure mix has been executed through a land leasehold contract, which requires real estate developers to provide a certain proportion of public rental housing within commodity housing estates . This approach of embedding public housing units into commodity housing estates has been adopted by many local governments, resulting in the accelerated construction of public housing since  . Thus, the housing tenure mix is an effective economic tool for promoting public housing construction and adjusting housing prices in the housing market, which helps increase housing affordability and achieve sustainable urban development .\n\nAlthough the efficacy of housing tenure mix intervention for public housing provision has been verified in urban China , we can neither ascertain whether the primary sustainable and social well-being aim of this policy has been achieved nor the extent of this achievement . For instance, evidence of mixed communities impairing the neighborhood environment suggests that the housing tenure mix policy inevitably leads to increased community heterogeneity, which may challenge the development of neighborhood relationships, community social capital, social integration, and identification . On the whole, s from much of the research on the efficacy of housing tenure mix intervention for neighborhood improvement tend to be ambiguous , while the extant literature pays insufficient attention to the health consequences of residents' perceptions and feelings toward their mixed communities, especially in non-Western contexts . Therefore, it is important to examine the thorough impacts of the housing tenure mix policy on the characteristics of neighborhoods where residents set in, as well as the resultant health implications. This will help explore whether and to what extent housing tenure mix intervention contributes to the enhancement of population health and the development of healthy communities .\n\nFocusing on the potential impacts of mixed communities on mental health in urban China, we investigated six typical public housing estates developed across different periods of public housing development in urban Guangzhou. Accordingly, the present study aims to clarify whether and how housing tenure mix intervention can influence neighborhood characteristics, produce person-place bonds, and how this transactional process affects residents' quality of life and mental well-being. The pathways linking housing tenure mix status, neighborhood characteristics, sense of place, and mental health are proposed and empirically examined. Thus, this study can be regarded as an attempt to explore the pathogenetic mechanism of housing tenure mix affecting residents' mental health through neighborhood effects and person-place transactions. Further, this attempt is conducted within a typical developing Asian country , which extends the focal points of housing and urban health studies to non-Western contexts.",
        "7": " \n\nTo construct the theoretical framework of housing tenure mix and public health, we referred to two vital theoretical models that gain prominence in health promotion: social determinants of health models  and social-ecological models. With regards to the multidimensional impacts of housing\ntenure mix on the residences where people live, such as the visible changes in the quality of the built environment, social change in the types of people who live there, and economic change in the viability of the local housing market , we propose two possible mechanisms that are helpful for understanding the health implications of housing tenure mix intervention at the neighborhood level.\n\nFirst, according to the SDH models, we propose a socioeconomic mechanism in which the housing tenure mix could significantly impact residents' mental health by intervening in the neighborhood socioeconomic status. Aiming to tackle health inequalities in the middle- and lowincome countries or areas primarily, SDH models focus on explaining the \"causes of causes\" of health problems . The conditions referred to as social determinants of health significantly influence population health by shaping living conditions and quality of life . Among various social determinants, socioeconomic status is the fundamental cause of health problems. Housing tenure mix as a policy intervention to accelerate affordable housing provision in urban China inevitably influences residents' socioeconomic characteristics  and accordingly reshapes the socioeconomic position of one's area of residence. Thus, housing tenure mix can be regarded as a context-specific political intervention that reconfigures the neighborhood socioeconomic attribute, which significantly impacts population health as a structural determinant .\n\nSecond, referring to the social-ecological models, we raise an environmental mechanism that housing tenure mix can affect residents' mental health through various facets of both the built and social environment of the neighborhood . Mix communities are made of diverse residential buildings and house different social groups, and these mixed-built and social environments are believed to be closely associated with population health . Previous studies have tried to explain how public housing affects population health by addressing the neighborhood effects on individual conditions . Driven by mixed housing development, the improved quality of the built environment and increased social opportunities could contribute to residents' health-related and health outcomes, particularly among the lowincome population . The built environment of neighborhood influences residents' health in a \"hard\" way through material conditions , including land use morphometrics , transportation attributes , proximity to public facilities , and design features . While the social environment of neighborhood affects health in a \"soft\" way through meanings and symbols in the neighborhood , such as that the importance of social cohesion and social support for people's physical and mental health is well known in the literature .\n\nNotably, social-ecological studies point out that people's transactions with the built and social environments are determinative of their mental well-being . So the perceptions of neighborhood environment are closely linked with residents' self-rated mental health, including both positive aspects  and the negative aspects of neighborhood problems . For instance, evidence shows the links between perceived physical environmental factors and mental health among Australian adults , and various aspects of perceived social and physical neighborhood environment are associated with self-rated health in Wales, UK . Therefore, to understand the mental health implications of people's experiences of living in mixed communities, the perception of neighborhood environment  should be investigated as significant health determinants.",
        "8": "  \n\nBesides the socioeconomic and environmental mechanisms focusing on the mediation of neighborhood characteristics between housing policy intervention and public health, the underlying mechanisms of neighborhood effects on individual health should be further explained. Among a considerable amount of research that focuses on neighborhood effects on individual health, neighborhood has often been regarded as a \"place\" by environmental psychologists and human geographers . The place is an essential construct that links neighborhood characteristics with personal health since the physical and social dimensions of neighborhoods are \"cues\" for people to develop emotional and sentimental relationships with their residence . Emotional sentimental bonding between people and where they live matters in delivering a healthy community , and the place-making process is thus of great importance to provide health-promoted neighborhood environment . Place-making of residence corresponds to \"an ongoing creation, maintenance, and even contestation of a sense of place\" , where person-place transactions play vial intermediary roles between the neighborhood characteristics and individual health, and such links are more commonly found for the facets of mental state and psychological well-being .\n\nSense of place, as a representative construct of the person-place process, emanates from the experiences and perceptions of individuals , revealing the relationships between human and environmental systems . A sense of place is born when a space is converted into a place with special behavioral and emotional characteristics . Meanings and affinities ascribed to a place are constructed and subsequently redefined by individuals and communities . Within the transformation of neighborhood-level variables into a meaning-construction process by different individuals , a sense of place may play an important intermediary role that suggests a person-place transactional mechanism .\n\nHowever, the connotation of sense of place has been dealt with loosely in different sorts of studies; particularly, its interrelations with other place-related constructs make its research difficult . Referring to the three vital dimensions of the personplace process, namely, emotion, cognition, and behavior , three most often mentioned place-centered constructs-place attachment, place identity, place dependence-can be reorganized under the umbrella concept of sense of place . Place attachment, an affective relationship between people and environments, represents an emotional interaction with place . Place identity, a cognitive aspect of human-place interaction, is a substructure of self-identification in relation to environments which is produced and modified through human dialogue . Place dependence refers to how well a place serves goal achievement compared with alternative places, which reflects the strength of the association between people and the environment based on their living behaviors . In this study, we consider the above three concepts as subcomponents of sense of place, and each of them should be associated with personal health to some extent.\n\nConsistent with the three facets, sense of place can promote personal health since positive emotional, and cognitive bonds with neighborhood settings can provide psychological benefits such as the development of self-identity and a sense of environmental mastery . Emotionally, place attachment is considered protective of psychological well-being in most studies . Cognitively, place identity impacts health in multiple ways, including shaping health-related experiences, thus, affecting stress and coping mechanisms, as well as nurturing social capital . However, behaviorally, we find little evidence of an association between place dependence and individual health. In contrast, the imagination, perception, and meaning ascribed to a place can also have negative connotations, such as stereotyping or the stigmatization of poor, ghettoized, and declined neighborhoods, which can lead to poorer health\n\nFigure . Research hypotheses on housing tenure mix, neighborhood characteristics, sense of place and mental health.\nand quality of life . Thus, the multidimensional attributes of sense of place make it challenging to comprehensively understand its health implications, particularly when we still know little about how different aspects of sense of place interact and collaborate to influence health . To respond, it is necessary to unfold the different effects of each element of sense of place on individual health, to make a general picture of how sense of place transforms a space into a place.",
        "9": "  \n\nBased on the proposed theoretical mechanisms between housing tenure mix, neighborhoods, and mental health, this study raised the following three research hypotheses to explore the pathways of housing tenure mix intervention affecting mental health in urban China, visualized in Figure .\n\n- Hypothesis  : A socioeconomic mechanism: housing tenure mix influences residents' mental health via intervening in the neighborhood socioeconomic status.\n- Hypothesis  : An environmental mechanism: housing tenure mix affects people's perception of the neighborhood environment, contributing to or impeding their mental health accordingly.\n- Hypothesis  : A person-place transactional mechanism: sense of place is an intermediatory factor between neighborhood characteristics and mental health.\n\nAccordingly, four influential paths were proposed and examined:\n Housing tenure mix  neighborhood socioeconomic status  mental health\n Housing tenure mix  neighborhood socioeconomic status  sense of place  mental health\n Housing tenure mix  perceived neighborhood environment  mental health\n Housing tenure mix  perceived neighborhood environment  sense of place  mental health",
        "11": " \n\nGuangzhou was selected as a case city because of its innovative implementation of housing tenure mix policies . A multi-stage sampling method was employed to investigate residents who are most likely to be influenced by housing tenure mix intervention. First, we used purposive sampling to select typical residential neighborhoods, considering their developmental stages and the relevant housing policy context, geographical heterogeneity, population scale, the composition of housing tenure, and\n\nFigure . Location of the selected cases.\nneighborhood socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. Accordingly, six housing estates were selected, whose development ages range from the late s to s: Jin Sha Zhou neighborhood , Ju De , Tang De Garden , Rui Dong Garden , Fang He Garden , and Long Gui Garden . JSZ is a pioneer public housing project in Guangzhou that aims to solve housing shortages for low-income populations, which has experienced the longest and the most mature development. The development of JD and TD has spanned different housing policy stages and was affected by the housing market filtering mechanism, resulting in a diverse neighborhood socioeconomic structure. RD is a relatively new developed public housing project, comprised of public rental housing, subsidized home ownership housing and commodity housing. While FH and LG are comprised of public rental housing and subsidized home ownership housing, with the exclusion of commodity housing.\n\nSecond, due to the inability to directly obtain residential addresses and phone numbers of the potentially eligible participants as mandated by Personal Information Protection Law of China, research team members visited various locations for recruiting participants in person. In each neighborhood convenience sampling was applied, and we use multiple means to recruit questionnaire participants to increase randomization. For example, we approach them in different time-frame of a day , different streets, different locations . We also aim to make sure the overall age and sex distribution are proportional to the\n\nFigure . The structural framework of path analysis.\n\n\nSource: Guangzhou housing security office\npercentages observed in the population. During the questionnaire survey conducted June -, , five sets of factors were investigated: self-reported mental health outcomes, housing tenure mix status and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, the perception of neighborhood environment; a sense of place, and individual socio-demographic characteristics. Finally,  adult participants who have been living in the neighborhood for at least  year were recruited, and  samples were removed due to the invalid responses, leaving a total  valid surveys.",
        "13": " \n\nMental health is not merely the absence of mental illness but also comprised of positive feelings and positive functioning, referring to \"a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\" . More inclusive, mental health is regarded as \"a dynamic state of internal equilibrium which enables individuals to use their abilities in harmony with universal values of society\" . To precisely capture the attributes of the key factors for mental health, we adopted two different types of measurements to assess residents' mental health condition.\n\nFirst, we adopted the Medical Outcome Studies Short-Form  Health Survey questionnaire , which is a valid, reliable, and sensitive measurement for multiple Chinese populations . This questionnaire is widely used as a quality-of-life measure and comprises the Mental Health subscale and the Physical health subscale. The construct validity of the Mental Health subscale is to measure mental functioning and the resultant quality of life, and the latter includes both negative effect  and positive effect .\n\nSecond, we employed the Mental Health Continuum Short Form  to further evaluate three key components of mental health: emotional well-being , psychological well-being , and social well-being . The MHC-SF shows very good internal consistency  and discriminant validity among adults in various contexts . The internal consistency of our data was also satisfactory .\n\nWe used these two measurements to comprehensively understand the mental health impacts of housing tenure mix, involving both residents' mental functioning and their internal equilibrium.\nComparatively, the Mental Health SF- measurement evaluates individual mental functioning, focusing on the effects of mental state on the quality of daily life, while the MHC-SF measurement emphasizes an individual's internal feelings. With the Mental Health SF- subscale, we calculated the mental health summary measures  based on its user's manual . Higher summary scores indicate better mental function and higher quality of life, and scores above or below  can be interpreted as above or below the general population norm. With the MHCSF scale, we calculated the summary mean score, and higher scores indicate better internal equilibrium.",
        "14": "  \n\nDue to the difficulty in obtaining neighborhood-level data from public surveys in China, we measured housing tenure mix status and neighborhood socioeconomic status based on the individual-level data file , which has proven to be a reliable method with adequate samples . Based on information theory, we adopted the calculation of the entropy measure of information, which is excellent for the variation of nominal variables, to measure the level of housing tenure mix and structural attributes of neighborhood socioeconomic status .\n\nFor housing tenure mix, four types of housing units with different tenures were distinguished according to housing tenure and homeownership: public rental housing, subsidized home ownership housing, private rental housing, and privately owned commodity housing. Further, we used the mixture levels of household monthly income and employment status as the two indicators to evaluate neighborhood socioeconomic status. Accordingly, three household income groups were identified: low-income families , middle-income families , and better-off families  ; four employment types were classified . Then the proportions of each type  relative to the total were used in the calculation of the entropy measure, which is defined as:\n\n\nH=-\\Sigma_{i} p_{i} \\ln p_{i}\n\n\nwhere pi is the probability of an observation belonging to category i of X , and pi   for  .\n\nTo standardize  can be calculated according to the following formula:\n\n\n\\mathrm{H}^{\\prime}=\\mathrm{H} / \\ln \\mathrm{I}\n\n\nwhere I is the maximum number of categories that the neighborhood has . This entropy measure runs from , with  implying absolutely no variation and one standing for absolute variation. Accordingly, five categories of the mixture level could be classified:  absolutely homogenous , just one type present,  homogeneous ,  average homogeneous ,  average heterogeneous , and  heterogeneous .",
        "15": " \n\nThe perception of neighborhood environment was measured from two vital facets of the built and social environment. According to the main components of the built environment in literature, four perceived built environmental factors were developed: the convenience of public facilities, satisfaction with green and open space, transportation accessibility, and micro-environment quality. In addition, perceived neighborhood cohesion was chosen as the most important and representative social environment factor. Afterward, we built an individual neighborhood perception scale and transformed it into five contextual variables at the neighborhood level, since the way people perceive\na place is inherently tied to the relationship between people and what they view as their environment .\n Convenience of public facilities was measured by asking respondents to indicate how convenient of going to the following four public facilities from their home: schools, pharmacies, and community clinics, the nearest hospital with a casualty department, and fitness or leisure facilities. A five-point scale  was adopted, and an average of the four scores was calculated, forming an internally consistent scale.\n Satisfaction with green and open space was evaluated by asking residents to what extent they agree with six statements on the quality, quantity, and aesthetics of green and open space: \"This neighborhood has plenty of greenery ,\" \"The green landscape design is exquisite,\" \"The open space is in suitable size,\" \"The neighborhood has ample space for public activities,\" \"There are suitable playgrounds for children to play freely in my neighborhood,\" \"There are very attractive scenic spots/green landscape in the neighborhood.\" A five-point Likert scale was used , and the mean of the six scores was computed, forming an internally consistent scale .\n Transportation accessibility was measured by asking people to indicate to what extent they agree with four statements: \"There are sufficient public transportation facilities around my neighborhood,\" \"I am satisfied with the public transportation facilities,\" \"Our neighborhood is accessible from other regions of Guangzhou,\" \"Few traffic jams happen around the neighborhood.\" Based on an average of the above four scores with a five-point Likert scale , perceived transportation accessibility could be assessed.\n Micro-environmental quality was measured by asking people to what extent they agree with four statements on noise, ventilation, and sanitation: \"The ventilation of this neighborhood is good,\" \"It is quiet of living here,\" \"The neighborhood is clean and tidy with good hygiene.\" A five-point Likert scale was used, and the mean score of these three responses was calculated, indicating the overall quality of the micro-environment of the neighborhood .\n Neighborhood cohesion was measured by asking respondents to what extent they agree with six statements: \"People know their neighbors in this community,\" \"I regularly stop and talk with my neighbors,\" \"I visit my neighbors in their homes,\" \"People around here are willing to help their neighbors,\" \"This is a close-knit neighborhood,\" \"People in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other\" . A five-point response scale was used, and the average of responses to the six statements was summed, forming an internally consistent scale .",

        "18": " \n\nDescriptive statistics  were used to capture the characteristics of the samples. A preliminary Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to test health differences among neighborhoods with different levels of housing tenure mix. A quick check on the associations between housing tenure mix and neighborhood socioeconomic status  was conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square statistics. Further, we employed path analysis, a form of multiple regression statistical analysis for evaluating causal models, to examine the four paths proposed in our research hypotheses. Since it is often used when one or more variables are proposed to mediate the relationship between two others, we constructed path analysis models to examine the intermediatory roles of neighborhood characteristics  between housing tenure mix and mental health, and the mediating roles of sense of place between neighborhood characteristics and mental health .\n\nIn total, eight models were constructed, among which four models used the SF- MCS score  as the outcome variable, and the other four used the average score of MHC-SF  as the outcome variable. The independent variable was housing tenure mix status in all the models. There were two levels of mediating factors, first, neighborhood characteristic factors  were the first-level mediators between housing tenure mix and mental health. Perceived neighborhood environmental factors were correlated to account for the potential influence of unobserved variables. Second, sense of place  was the second-level mediator liking neighborhood characterize factors and mental health. Furthermore, the confounding effects of individual sociodemographic factors on sense of place and mental health were controlled.

The  of the Mantel-Haenszel Chi-square tests on the linear relationship between housing tenure mix and neighborhood socioeconomic status indicated a strong linear relationship between housing tenure mix status and income mix status , so that a higher level of housing tenure mix contributed to a higher level of income mix. In contrast, there was no significant linear relationship between housing tenure mix and employment mix , suggesting that housing mix status has little effect on the mixed level of employment stability with this data.

For the impact of housing tenure mix on neighborhood characteristics, the eight models consistently showed that:  Housing tenure mix was positively associated with income mix status, suggesting that housing tenure mix has reshaped neighborhood socioeconomic status.  Housing tenure mix contributed to a higher quality of perceived neighborhood environment both physically and socially .",
        "22": " \n\nBased on statistical , we reveal that the housing tenure mix affected residents' mental health through multiple pathways: socioeconomic mechanisms, environmental mechanisms, or person-place transactional mechanisms, which are further addressed as follows.\n\n\n\n\n:    .",
        "23": " Negative mental health implications of income mix: The socioeconomic mechanism \n\nIn response to H, this study ascertains that housing tenure mix has increased mental health risks via the socioeconomic mechanism within the context of Guangzhou, since neighborhood income mix status was negatively associated with residents' mental health conditions. A higher level of neighborhood income mix could directly impede residents' mental functioning, which subsequently jeopardizes their quality of life. However, we found no significant effect of neighborhood income mix on resident's sense of place and internal well-being.\n\nEchoing extant studies, our finding supports the opinion that housing tenure mix could naturally lead to social mix to some extent, as income mix is a representative indicator for social mixing . However, our study shows that income mix seems not a desirable outcome on mental health grounds, challenging the justification of housing tenure mix approach in pursuing social equity. One possible reason is that mixing different income groups within the same neighborhood may lead to a sense of income inequality, which is a vital social determinant of mental disorders . At national level, increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and decreased general happiness have been reported in countries with more income inequality . At county-level in China, income inequality has been found to be negatively associated with subjective well-being, and this association is stronger for people with urban household registration status than those with rural registration status . Consistently, we infer that at neighborhood level, a similar socioeconomic mechanism may also function between neighborhood income inequality and individual mental health outcomes, such as that residents from neighborhoods with more heterogeneous income reported poorer mental health conditions in our study. To conclude, we believe that housing tenure mix negatively influences residents' mental health via the intermediary role of income mix; furthermore, regarding income mix as an indicator for measuring income inequality, the risks of housing tenure mix impeding social equity and public health should be carefully addressed in future housing policies.",
        "24": " Health benefits of housing tenure mix: The environmental mechanism and person-place transactional pathways\n\nIn response to hypotheses  and , we found that perception of neighborhood environment and sense of place served as important mediators between housing tenure mix and mental health, supporting the hypotheses of the environmental and person-place transactional mechanism.\n\nConsistent with the opinions of scholars who support housing mix policies , we further add additional evidence on the protective effects of housing tenure mix on the perception of neighborhood environment, which could be explained by the environmental mechanism. Within our cases, increased housing tenure mix level contributed to residents' perception of neighborhood environment both physically and socially. Although some social media and some research within the Chinese context point out the challenges of housing\ntenure mix regarding physical or social segregation within housing tenure mixed neighborhood , our empirical study did not find negative associations between housing tenure mix and perceptions of built and social environments.\n\nTo understand the authentic relationship between housing tenure mix and residents' perception of neighborhood environment, we further examine the potential links by comparing two representative neighborhoods. Based on the descriptive analysis of the perception of neighborhood environment, respondents from FH Garden reported the best-perceived quality of neighborhood environment among all cases. In contrast, respondents from LG Garden presented the poorest perception. Meanwhile, the entropy measure of housing tenure mix showed that FH Garden was categorized as a heterogenous neighborhood  and LG Garden was an absolutely homogenous neighborhood . Additionally, both FH Garden and LG Garden belonged to public housing estates, with the exclusion of commodity housing, indicating comparability in terms of the housing development and allocation mechanisms. Specifically, both the perceived built environment and social environment of FH Garden \\left. Theoretically, the divergence of the perceived social environment could be attributed to different levels of housing tenure mix, since a mixture of different housing tenure types may enrich various interpersonal networks and increase social opportunities, which could be conducive to neighborhood cohesiveness. We thus infer that a higher mixture of different public housing types, particularly with more proportion of subsidized home ownership housing , could contribute to a cohesive and supportive social environment. This positive effect of housing mix intervention is consistent with findings from some social housing studies in Western countries such as the United Kingdom .\n\nHowever, it is difficult to deduce the causation between housing tenure mix and the perceived built environment in this study since various confounders are hard to be controlled, such as the positioning and location of the housing projects. Regarding FH Garden and LG Garden, the former one has been developed as a \"sample project\" of public housing development in Guangzhou, enjoying convenient service facilities and public transportation, decorated with a relatively high standard, and even employed energy saving and emission reduction technology. Comparatively, LG Garden, known as the largest public housing neighborhood in Guangzhou, was located farther from the city center than FH Garden, surrounded by urban villages and factories, with relatively fewer public facilities. In this sense, we propose that housing tenure mix may not directly link with the perceived built environment, while it is the positioning, planning and design of the housing project that determine the built environment characteristics largely. The built environment could be greatly improved if the housing development body implements higher planning and design standards to deliver public housing projects.\n\nFurthermore, high-quality perception of the neighborhood environment can directly increase an individual's mental functioning while indirectly contributing to personal internal well-being via a sense of place. Echoing the environmental mechanism, satisfaction with green and open spaces is the shared perceived environmental factor conducive to both mental functioning and internal wellbeing robustly and significantly. This pathway has been well established in the literature , and this study provides strong empirical support within the context of mixed communities in urban China.\n\nRegarding the relationship between the perception of the neighborhood environment and mental health, we identify the mediating roles of person-place transactional factors. On the one hand, we found that convenient public facilities, satisfying green and open spaces, quality micro-environment, and cohesive neighborhood have contributed to residents' sense of place. These associations are theoretically supported by previous studies, such as the argument that the perception of neighborhood environment can affect person-place transactions by affecting everyday activities, social interactions, and emotional experiences . Specifically, public facilities and open spaces are\nimportant for activities, and social engagements in people's daily lives , whereas green space and micro-environments related to the visual and sensory comfort of residents, are crucial to help people relax and conduct recreational behaviors . And living in a cohesive neighborhood increases the possibility of sharing informal information, helps maintain healthy behavioral norms, provides affective support and mutual respect, and contributes to daily problem-solving, through which a sense of place can be developed . These benefits increase the residents' fondness for and closeness to their place of residence.\n\nOn the other hand, we point out that the aforementioned experiences related to sense of place could increase one's internal well-being. Gustavsson and Elander  claimed that sense of place affects health across three main domains: material, psychological, and social. This claim is supported by our findings of the pathways linking the perceived neighborhood environment, sense of place, and internal well-being. How people feel about, identify, and attach to a built and social environment can affect their health and well-being . The specific associations between sense of place  and internal well-being have been observed from our data, echoing the existing arguments on the health benefits of emotional bonds, interactions, and self-identification in relation to the environment . We thus argue that all three subcomponents of sense of placeplace attachment, place identity, and place dependence-with the residing neighborhood are important protective factors for residents' internal well-being.",
        "25": "  \n\nAccording to the practices of housing tenure mix in urban Guangzhou over the past decades, this study identified three mechanisms of housing tenure mix affecting mental health. First, a socioeconomic mechanism has been acknowledged as housing tenure mix has resulted in a mixture of income at the neighborhood level, indicating a sense of socioeconomic inequality and further impeding residents' mental functioning. Second, an environment mechanism has been partially ascertained between housing tenure mix and mental health since it could address the association between housing tenure mix and perceived social environment and the association between satisfaction with green and open space and mental functioning/internal well-being. Third, a person-place transactional mechanism has been fully identified by confirming the intermediatory role of sense of place  between the perception of the neighborhood environment and internal well-being. To summarize, housing tenure mix policy has directly impeded residents' mental functioning via its inherent association with socioeconomic inequality. Meanwhile, the appropriate level of housing tenure mix within public housing neighborhoods could increase neighborhood cohesion, further improving the sense of place, which could protect an individual's internal well-being. Therefore, housing tenure mix has direct and negative implications on individual mental state and resultant influences on their quality of life; however, it has indirect and positive impacts on individual internal feelings via perceived social cohesion and the sense of place.\n\nRegarding policy implications, the impacts of housing tenure mix on neighborhood income differentiation should be further addressed and be carefully concerned during housing policymaking in future, which is important for reducing the mental health risks derived from socioeconomic inequality. Meanwhile, an appropriate mixture of housing tenure types should be encouraged within public housing projects to nurture social opportunities and cohesive social environment and a sense of place, increasing well-being benefits for residents accordingly. Moreover, as the ways of implementing housing tenure mix initiative could determine the quality of the built environment largely, we propose that the local government should implement higher planning and design standards to ensure the quality built environment of public housing neighborhoods. Whereas, the causality of housing tenure mix affecting the perception of\nneighborhood environment  should be further studied. This is also associated with the inevitable limitation of this study: the cross-sectional design of the study limited its capacity to determine causality, and this issue should be addressed in a longitudinal study when we are able to collect data for several rounds."
