This article investigates exploratory the office design's role for employees' welfare from different perspectives. ORJECTIVE: By comparing different studies of the office, type's influence on different factors of employees' welfare the aim is to see if any common patterns exist in office design's impact. : The three included studies investigate office type's association with employees' welfare by measuring its influence on: a) perception of leadership, b) sick leave, and c) job satisfaction.\n\nThe sample consists of office employees from a large, national representative work environment survey that work in one of the seven identified office types in contemporary office design:  cell-offices;  shared-room offices;  small,  medium-sized and  large open-plan offices;  flex-offices and  combi-offices. Statistical method used is multivariate logistic and linear regression analysis with adjustment for  factors. : Overall  show that shared-room office, traditional open plan offices and flex-office stand out negatively, but to different degree on the different outcomes measured. S: This explorative comparison of different studies finds a pattern of office types that repeatedly show indications of negative influence on employees' welfare, but further studies are needed to clarify this.\n\n\n Office type, sick leave, leadership, job satisfaction, design features",
        "3": " . \n\nThe work environment is not only an important component in the daily life for the working force in the society, it has also an impact on people's health and well-being. We know from empirical studies that ill-health and absenteeism is related to job characteristics such as high work demands, poor job control, monotonous work and so on . We also know there are gender differences with regard to this. Women are exposed to other risk factors , and are in comparison to men more stressed and have less good health , and also higher sickness absenteeism .\n\nDespite the fact that a majority of the workforce in the Western society today works in offices \nand white-collar workers are faced with other environmental stressors than blue collar-workers, health and well-being in relation to the physical office environment is not well researched.\n\nThe research that exists on office environments has mainly been occupied with investigating individual environmental factors or psychological state and behaviors related to these. Noise is the individual environmental factor most studied. Noise, by definition unwanted sound, is the major environmental stressor in offices, especially open plan offices . It has negative effects on health outcomes such as self-reported health and stress , as well as cognitive performance . Noise disturbance correlates with dissatisfaction with privacy, something clarified by Sundstrom's  definition of\nprivacy in two sub-categories - acoustical and visual privacy. Acoustic privacy includes both speech privacy and isolation from noise, while visual privacy includes isolation from unwanted observation and visual stimuli. The somewhat symbiotic relationship between noise disturbance and perception of privacy among office employees shows clearly in a study by Bodin Danielsson  in which it was found that employees working in traditional open plan offices report both more noise disturbances and more lack of privacy, especially acoustic privacy. Beside noise, the other major environmental stressor in shared workspaces is crowding. It is a psychological state of interference, as a result of high density and lack of space, or non-desired levels of stimulation or interaction and interference with activities . Crowding has been found to have negative consequences on employees with regard to stress levels, blood pressure, social withdrawal, satisfaction, turnover intentions and task performance .\n\nPerception of environmental stressors such as noise and crowding is related to a concept called personal control, which is fundamental for employee health and well-being . Personal control can be described as the individual's need to be in control over the situation. In a work context, this includes the psychosocial environment and work characteristics such as work assignments, decision authority, deadlines etc., but also the physical work environment and control over stimuli from the surrounding environment.\n\nExposure to environmental stimuli in an office environment is to a high degree determined by work station design and office layout . Office layout in turn is highly related to office types. Thus, the defining features of the office type are important when investigating office design's role for employees' welfare. Due to this, all three studies included in this explorative study of the subject have their starting point in the seven office types identified in contemporary office design defined by their unique combination of architectural and functional features . The present study compares the  from three studies, which individually investigate the office type's relation to different outcomes of employees' welfare or dimension important to employees' welfare. The focus in these three included studies is:  sick-leave rates,  perception of managerial leadership, and  dimensions important to job satisfaction. With this comparative approach, the aim is it to see if there is any common pattern in how office type per se\ninfluences different factors important to employees' welfare. If this is the case, what could then explain this? The study is exploratory to its character, aiming to point out future directions in this field of research by looking for similarities and differences in how the office type influences different factors of importance to employees' welfare.",
        "5": " .. \nIn all three studies, the sample consists of office employees, which comes from the  and  waves of Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health . SLOSH is a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study of work environment and health. It covers different aspects of the general life situation and working life, including organizational aspects as well as the physical work environment with questions about office types. The sample in the included sick leave study come from the  and  wave since this is a prospective study. While the sample of the leadership study is from  and the latter job satisfaction study is from . The analytic sample varies between the studies with , respondents in the leadership study, , respondents in the on-going job satisfaction study and , respondents in the prospective sick leave study. The smaller sample in the latter study is due to different sorts of drop outs of respondents between two years measured, i.e.  and .",
        "6": " .. \n\nIn the sick leave and leadership study, multivariate logistic regression analyses are performed to study the possible influence of office type on different outcome variables important for employee welfare. While in the job satisfaction study a linear regression analysis is performed. Office type is used as an explanatory factor in analyses of all three studies. In the two former studies, i.e. the sick leave and leadership study, the following  factors are treated as confounders: sex, age, labor market sector and job rank. In the third on-going study on factors important for job satisfaction the confounders are: age and education. All confounders are treated as categorical variables. In the sick leave and leadership studies analyses of both the total sample and sex stratified analyses are conducted, whereas in the study on\nfactors important for job satisfaction only sex stratified analyses are conducted. Thus, sex is not treated as a confounder in this latter study.\n\nFor details on both sample and statistical analyses regarding the office type's association to sick leave rates and perception of managerial leadership see studies by Bodin Danielsson et al. .",
        "7": " .. \n\nAll three studies are based on the seven office types that have been identified in contemporary office design:  cell-office,  shared-room office,  small open-plan office,  medium- sized open-plan office,  large open-plan office,  flex-office, and  combi-office . The office types are defined by their unique set up of architectural and functional features. Since there exists offices that differ with regard to the defining features the office types should be regarded as prototypes . The architectural features are the physical features of an office type of which the plan layout is the most prominent. The functional features of an office type are determined by the work taking place in the office and how this is organized, in other words the use of the office and functions related to this. These features are in turn determined by factors such as functional needs, technical feasibility , but it also works vice versa, as technical and functional possibilities can lead to new organization of work that affects the architectural design. In the third study on the office, type's influence on factors important for job satisfaction the sixth office type flex-office is not represented. Instead, hot-desking office, a sub-group of flex-office is represented. Similar to flex-office employees not having any personal workstation define this sub-group, but other than that, it shares no other defining features. In hot-desking offices, there is lack of access to different work environments within office and low degrees of decision authority, which clearly differentiates it to flex-office. That the participants in this study who indicated that they work in an office with nonpersonal workstations in fact worked in hot-desking offices and not flex- office was revealed by the initial descriptive analyses by low decision authority among the employees in this office category. This shows clearly in the  of how decision authority is reported by the employees in this sub-category in comparison others office types .",
        "8": " .. \n\nSick-leave study - the three dimensions used as outcomes to measure sickness absence are:\n \"Short sick leave spells\" was measured by the question: 'How many times have you taken sick leave for a week or less during the past  months? Do not count care of a sick child.' The responses were dichotomized into one or no short absences  vs. two or more spells.\n \"Number of long sick leave spells\"  was measured by the question: 'How many times have you taken sick leave for longer than a week during the past  months? Do not count care of a sick child.' The response was dichotomized into no long absences  vs. all other categories.\n \"Total number of sick leave days the past year\" was measured by the response to the question: 'Approximately how many days have you in total been on sick leave during the last  months?' The response was dichotomized into  days or less vs. more than  days.\n\nFor details see study by Bodin Danielsson et al. .\n\nLeadership study - the three different scales used to measure employees' perception of managerial leadership are:\n The global leadership and organizational behaviour effectiveness  programme, which measures participants immediate supervisor with regard to integrity; autocratic; self- interest; team integration and inspirational leadership.\n The modern work life questionnaire, which measures employees' perception of leadership by the question:  Does your manager show care for you? And  Does your manager listen to you and take in what you say?\n The leadership scale from the stress profile consists of ten items that describe aspects of the employees' relationship with the manager.\n\nFor details see study by Bodin Danielsson et al. .\n\nJob satisfaction study - two dimensions - psychosocial factors and work descriptive factors - are\nused to measure to employees' job satisfaction in this on-going study:\n Psychosocial environment was measured with questions about the psychological demands at work and social support between colleagues at work.\n Work descriptive factors focused on the decision authority and skill discretion in employees' work assignments.",
        "10": " .. \n\nIn this study of the prospective effect of office design on sickness absence we find very different  for the three dimensions investigated, with a significant association mainly found in terms of short sick leave spells . In this respect, the three traditional open plan offices excel negatively in terms of both the total sample and women separately. Also in terms of long sick leaves women report higher risk of long sick leave spells in large open plan offices. Among men, only one office type stands out negatively - flex-office. Here men report both significantly higher risks for short sick leave spells and higher total number of sick days. Some of the , such as the excessed risk for sickness absence in the traditional open plan offices is in line with other studies that have found these three office types to be less conducive to health. A significantly higher risk for ill-health has e.g. been found in traditional open plan offices in both a cross-sectional study , and a longitudinal study .\n\nWhy traditional open plan offices appears to be less good from a health perspective may have several explanations. It could both be a higher risk of infection sharing workspace with many people, and a higher exposure to environmental stressors, such as noise and less ability for personal control in these office types. The tendency for better outcomes on sickness absence in cell-offices may be result of several factors for example a higher personal control as well as lower risks for infection in the former. While the explanation for this tendency for better health in combi-office is instead possibly related to group dynamics and social coherence, since strong group identity is likely to develop in a smaller group of people . Peer control is also more likely to\ndevelop among employees working in close collaboration with each other . Positive aspect of social control could be that people are more missed when absent in smaller groups due to a better visual overlook and a greater concern for team members. It could also be that the individual's work effort is more noticeable or that the individual is less easily replaceable in a smaller workgroup or team, due to a greater dependence of each other. This latter hypothesis could possibly explain why people that work collectively are more likely to be present at work despite being sick .\n\nAll together, these hypotheses could explain both the higher sickness absenteeism in traditional openplan office and especially in large open office, but also the better outcomes in both cell- and combi-office.",
        "11": " .. \n\nThe  of this study reveal differences in perceived managerial leadership between office employees in different office types. This indicates that the defining features of different office types may affect how managerial leadership is perceived by employees and possibly also how leadership is exercised. We see that employees working in shared-room offices followed by those in flex-offices are less satisfied with their closest supervisor. In contrast to this, the most satisfied employees are found in mediumsized open plan offices, with the other office types falling in between.\n\nIn the study a special focus concerns possible gender differences in perception of managerial leadership in different office types. However,  reveal no such difference, apart from in the small open plan offices. Here male employees rate the managerial leadership as better than in cell-offices, the reference category in the statistical analysis, while women instead rate leadership as less good in this office type.\n\nA hypothesis for the found differences in perception of leadership between office types is that these are due to the defining features of the office types. In accordance with this, these features can either support or inhibit the development of close relationship between managers and employees because the manager is not physically and/or visually present for the employees in the daily work. The same features could also, according to this hypothesis, be positive for the\nOffice types - prototypes defined by architectural and functional features\n\n\nNote: *There is a sub-group called hot-desking to flex-office. Hot-desking is similar to flex-office in that the workspace is not dimensioned for the whole workforce, and that employees have no personal workstation. It different to flex-office on two important features - it does not offer employees different work environments within office, work is also often characterized by a low degree of decision authority.\nemployees if there is trust and equal balance between parties, since they also enable personal control and independence. To exemplify, the architectural features of the cell-office make the manager visually less present leading to that employees and managers have to actively seek each other out for one-to-one meetings. Otherwise they will meet only in formal meetings or when encountering each other in common\nareas. However, according to this study a visually less present manager appears to be no problem in cell-office. Something that might be explained by the high degree of personal control in this office type, leading to both higher environmental satisfaction and job satisfaction among its employees .\n\nSickness absenteeism: Prospective associations between office types in  and sickness absence outcomes in  expressed as odds ratios from logistic models adjusted for  factors \n\n\nNote:  Reference category.

        "12": " .. \n\nThe preliminary  of this on-going study on the office type's possible influence on job satisfaction show that independent of dimension measured related to job satisfaction it is the same office types that stand out . The office types that stand out are shared-room office and small open plan office, but also hot-desking office stand out, i.e. the sub-group of flex-office, stand out . The overall picture shows that especially in terms of psychosocial factors a negative influence on employees, and then especially in terms of psychological demands among employees in hot-desking offices. In terms of social support among colleagues at work, significantly negative association between office type and social support is found only among men - this is in small open plan office followed by hot-desking office.\n\nWith regard to the work descriptive factors the preliminary  show that it is foremost in terms of decision authority we find an association with\noffice type. Once again, most negative association is found in the sub-group hot-desking office, followed by shared-room office. With regard to the other dimension investigated - skill discretion - a significant association is only found among women in large open plan office.\n\nIf we speculate, there are several possible explanations to why certain office type may have a negative influence on factors important to job satisfaction. The reason hot-desking office stand out most negatively could be the high cost efficiency of this office design with non-personal workstations and workspace often dimensioned for  or less of the workforce. An additional factor could be that it, unlike flex-office, does not offer a variety of work environments for different work assignments within the office. All together this leads to an exposed risk of noise disturbance and crowding without the ability to seek privacy when needed. This combined with the low degree of decision authority may explain the high psychological demands reported in hot-desking offices. It should be notified that the low decision authority found among employees in hot-desking\n\n\noffices is not surprising, since this low autonomy is a defining feature of this sub-group to flex-office.\n\nThe low degree of social support among men in hot-desking office may be a result of non-personal workstations, which can lead to less social coherence with colleagues. Why employees in shared-room with two to three people report significantly higher risks for high psychological demands as well as less decision authority than employees in other office types may be a result of other factors such as higher risk for negative social control and inability to withdraw when needed leading to more conflicts in a very small shared workspace. Or that the high psychological demands and low decision authority are related to the dissatisfaction with managerial leadership found among employees in this specific office types . The authors' hypothesis for the dissatisfaction with leadership in shared-room office is the higher risk for development of sub-group and less need for contact with management and others in the organization among employees in shared-room office.\n\nWith regard to gender differences in office type's influence on factors important to job satisfaction, the preliminary  of this study indicate some. We find for example among women more negative influence of small open plan office on both psychosocial and work descriptive factors. Overall, we find both stronger significances and more cases of negative influence on different outcomes among women, which indicates a greater sensitivity for environmental stimuli among women than men . It is only in hot-desking offices men show indications of negative influence on more outcomes, which indicates a greater sensitivity for the defining features of this sub-group such a low decision authority in combination with non-personal station and little access to different work environments within office.\n\nSee Table  (Source: Study by Bodin Danielsson, C. \\& Theorell, T. .",
        "13": " .. \n\nAll together gender differences found in this comparative investigation indicates a greater sensitivity for environmental stimuli among women than men, with the exception for the office designs where employees have no personal workstation, i.e. flexoffice and its sub-group hot-desking offices. In this specific case, more significant outcomes among men in this office category may be related to that the nonpersonal workstation can be perceived as less status and men are more sensitive to this than women.\n\nThe hypothesis of a greater sensitivity for environmental stimuli among women overall finds support in research that has found that more noise disturbances are reported among women , and that noise only correlates with absenteeism with high job complexity among women . There is also among women, but not among men, indications of increased risks for sickness absence in the traditional open plan office, where there is a great exposure to environmental stress .",
        "14": " .. \n\nThe major strengths of the study are the large size and that it is based on a nationally representative sample of workers. However, the study also has some limitations. As a nationally representative survey on work and health, SLOSH covers a very broad range of subjects, which means that there is limited space for questions specifically about office environments. As a consequence, it is likely that a number of participants were misclassified in terms of office type. However, unless there is some systematic bias in the classification, this is likely to result in an underestimation of the true effects of office type on the different outcomes investigated in the three studies described here.\n\nSince all data are self-reported we cannot know if the differences found in the three studies are due to actual differences between different office types or only due to differences in reporting problems between employees in different office types. With regard to the study on leadership this is more of a problem than in the other studies since we don't know if differences found can be attributed to differences in leadership style between the office types, or differences in employees' perception of leadership between office types. We consider it likely that perceptions and actual leadership behaviors are mutually related. Observations of manager - employee interaction in participants' office environments would therefore have been beneficial in this specific study, although very difficult to perform in a large and representative sample of office environments.\n\nThere are also some limitations related to covariates used in the statistical analyses. One limitation concerns the number of covariates used in the included studies that had to be limited due to statistical reasons. Another limitation concern  the covariates used to some degree varies between the studies. The same covariates are used in the sick leave and the leadership study, but not in the third study\non factors important for job satisfaction, where less covariates are used. However, age is used as covariate in all three studies. The greater gender focus in the on-going study on job satisfaction leads to that only sex stratified analyses are performed. Thus sex is not used as a covariates in this study. Neither are job rank or labour market sector, since our initial analyses revealed no impact of these on the outcome variables in the study, which instead educational level was found to have. The latter is thus included as a covariate. That the three studies do not always have the same covariates makes a direct comparison between the studies somewhat problematic. An additional limitation is that one of the studies, the sick leave study, has a prospective approach. However, one has to bear in mind that the initial aims of the included studies never was to compare them to one other, but to do the most relevant analyses based on their individual purposes. Most importantly though, all included studies use office type as  explanatory factor, which enables an unorthodox and exploratory approach in this comparison of the  of these three separate studies on office type's influence on employees' welfare.",
        "15": " .. \n\nThis comparison between the three studies does not give a fully unified picture of office type's influence on aspects important for employees' welfare. However, it is overall the same office types that stand out negatively. These office types are: shared-room office, traditional open plan office  and flexoffice/hot-desking office. Influence of office types vary internally between office types depending on the outcome variable studied.\n\nIf we examine the three the office types that stand out negatively we find indications of that shared-room office foremost has a negative influence on perception of leadership, and to some degree also on factors important to job satisfaction, while no association with sickness absenteeism is found. The traditional open plan offices appears instead to have  most negative influence on sickness absence. This group of office types has for both perception of leadership and factors important for job satisfaction a less strong influence according to this comparative investigation. The influence varies also highly between the different open plan offices. Finally, the last office type - flexoffice - has an influence only on some outcomes, and this varies highly between men and women. For sick-\nness absence flex-office has e.g. only a significantly negative influence on men in terms of short sick leave spells and total number of days . Also with regard to perception of leadership there are only negative influences of this office type among men. In the study on office type's influence on factors important to job satisfaction flex-office is not represented but instead its sub-group hot- desking office. We find indications of a fairly strong negative influence of office type on the outcomes in this study, including negative influence on both psychological demands on men and women, and on social support for men. Additionally, there is a negative influence on the outcome decision authority in hot-desking office, a characteristic feature of this. The more negative influence of hot-desking than flex-office in this study in comparison to flex-office in the other two studies. Something that may be related to that the defining features of this sub- group does not offer the employees the same ability for personal control as flex-office, which is considered fundamental to human well-being in different respect.",
        "16": " . \n\nTo conclude, this explorative investigation of three individual studies on the office type's influence on employees' welfare shows indications of influences - an influence that is negative. It appears however, that only some office types have this negative influence on employees' welfare. The fact that it is the same office types that stand out in almost all cases could be an indication that there is something in the defining features of these office types that have negative influences for office employees' welfare - both in terms of different dimension of employees' welfare and different factors important to employees' welfare. This shows a possible pattern in how the office types influences office employees' negatively. We find some common features for the office types that have this negative influence, which gives us an indication of which features could play a role here.\n\nThe study design of the present study does however not allow us to draw any clear s and it should thus only be viewed as a first step in the investigation of how different features in the office design may influences employees' welfare in different regard. The present study aims not to give any clear answers to the office design's influence on employees' welfare overall. Instead, it aims to give indications of what aspects could be worthwhile to\ninvestigate further. Future studies need a more precise study design, but also detailed analyses of the features that may play a central role for employees' welfare. Studies that look into the possible mediating effects of different outcomes as well as interactions between these in their relation to office type's influence on employees' welfare would also be beneficial."
