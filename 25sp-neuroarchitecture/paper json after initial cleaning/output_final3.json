        "2": " Analysis of the Influence of Cognitive-Emotional Design on Mental and Physical Human Health Using the Example in Public Architectural Environment of Downtown in Seoul, South Korea\n\nAlisa Kolova  and Tamer Abdallah Sammour ",
        "3": " \n\n The study's main objective is to identify how the architectural environment influences residents' mental and physical health living in Seoul, South Korea. One of the significant highlights of the study is to show the correlation between human psychology and architectural design that influences the ecosystem's health. Successful strategies can establish a positive relationship between psychological effects, including mental issues, and an ecosystem's health. Urban ecosystems have been associated with mental disorders, anxiety, and stress for centuries, with little research focusing on the major causes. New studies on neurourbanism tend to address these issues to tackle the urban challenges and promote the creation of green cities. The latest designs of Seoul, South Korea should create cities that consider the economic, physical, social, and environmental impact on mental issues on the current population without compromising future generations to experience the same.\n\nKeywords: Neuroarchitecture; urban ecosystem; neurourbanism; human well-being; green infrastructure.",
        "4": "\n\nEnvironmental psychology is an interdisciplinary field of research that examines the relationships between individuals and their surroundings. The term \"environment\" is widely defined in the field and encompasses natural habitats, social settings, artificial environments, learning environments, as well as informational environments, among others. Environmental psychologists are typically researchers interested in how people interact with and react to their physical and social environments. They may look at why certain people like recycling, what encourages individuals to adopt environmentallyfriendly practices, and why particular surroundings make people feel more productive and happier. Although there is a significant link between architectural design and human psychology, individuals both inside and outside the design industry generally don't recognise or even ignore this link . Apart from that, there is a significant and bidirectional reciprocal link between design and psychology. Kaplan discusses the importance of the environment on the psychological health, highlighting the psychological benefits that nearby nature offers .\n\nDesign has been shown to have significant physiological impacts, yet our perceptions of good design in our culture are influenced by a variety of factors, including psychology, human experience, and the way our brains work. Architects are always conscious of their work's influence on their clients and their way of life. Each of them is aware that factors such as the color of a place or the lighting in a room influence how people feel when\nexposed to design. Neuroarchitecture takes this a step further by comprehending how the design environment affects the brain's activities and processes to apply the findings to the conception and building of places. Creating environments in which the occupants' brains may be defined by everything from the layout to the wall colors is a joint endeavor between architects and neuroscientists. The difficulty is in comprehending why certain places promote or obstruct emotions and then intelligently constructing to accomplish a specific goal, whether it is a less hectic workplace, a health facility for healing, or a learning institution for a more advantageous learning experience, to name a few examples.",
        "5": " . The Mechanism of Neuroarchitecture \n\n\"Unscathed\" neuroarchitecture is built upon neurobiological tools like sweat sensors, electroencephalograms, and electrocardiograms for the objective measurement of how our corpus reacts to specific architectural stimuli in order to take into account the feelings elicited by architecture's design process. Architectural studies of today, however, fail to possess all these devices of science, neither do they have the time or technology to apply these findings to the designs of theirs. Facilities like the San Diego Architecture Neuroscience Academy or the Polytechnic University of Valencia's LENI Research Group on Neuroarchitecture are producing scientifically-based research. The LENI study is an example of how pediatric waiting rooms are designed. How do they operate? To begin with, a gathering of individuals evaluated aspects of the rooms of waiting to find out the ones that were most soothing. They then created an environment that improved these aspects. Digital simulation was a helpful equipment for neuroarchitecture in this process because it enables the utiliser to use an area, in spite of the fact that it has yet to be built, and research the impact of this environment on their behavior.",
        "6": " . The Impact of Green Areas on Human Health\n\nThe routes leading to health benefits in green areas are varied and complicated. Different models were developed to explain the connection between health and green space. Paiva and Jedon  recommended the following:  better quality of the air; higher activity physically; compensation of stress; and  increased cohesiveness. FINSA  identifies physical exercise, nature involvement, relaxation, and social connections as key health paths.  submitted that urban green space mitigates the impact of the urban heat island, offering protection against health risks linked to heat, improving capital social and cohesiveness, and improving activity physically. Besides the aforementioned paths, The United Workplace  proposed exposure to natural microorganisms and the increased immune system as an important connection between nature and health. Comparative contributions and their possible synergistic effects of the various routes are yet to be clarified. Meanwhile, a lack of understanding of the underpinning causal routes to well-being results and the complicated environmental and complex change variables impede targeted policy initiatives. In-depth multidisciplinary research is required to address such wisdom niches in health and urban environments .\n\nThere is good evidence of health advantages from psychological relaxation and restoration from interaction with greenspace and nature . In touch with nature , contacts were indicated to have beneficial effects for those with high-stress levels by changing them into a more positive emotional state  and stimuli in natural conditions may assist restore a feeling of well-being for people with mental tiredness.  indicated a key role for improved immune functioning in natural-health pathways. In Japan, associations have been shown among going to woodlands and favorable immunological responses, including the production of anticancer proteins . This indicates that systems of immunity gain from being exposed directly to natural settings or interaction with particular green area elements. Children who are more vulnerable to particular germs or allergens in the initial annum of life have also been found to be less likely to have recurrent wheezing and allergic sensitivity . It has been found that living in residential neighborhoods with more street trees has a reduced asthma prevalence .\n\nThe improvement of cardiovascular health, mental health, neurocognitive development, overall well-being, and prevention of obesity, cancer, and osteoporosis was shown with physical exercise . Providing accessible and beautiful urban settings\ncould motivate individuals to stay alone for longer and make exercise easier. The value of green urban space and the availability of particular facilities contribute to the physical activity of older adults . Physical exercise in a green environment may be especially beneficial for urban people with mental health issues . There is considerable evidence that urban green spaces benefit from mental health . Greater neighborhood greenery has been significantly linked to better mental health . As well, greater greenery across all socioeconomic strata and in both sexes has been associated with better physical and mental well-being in Spain . The connections were greater for the surrounding greenery assessed by the NDVI than for accessibility geographically unique green areas. Further research has also shown that physical exercise has not mediated this relationship.",
        "7": " . Neurarchitecture and Neurourbanism in South Korea \n\nDespite the danger of nuclear and missile strikes Northern missile strikes, a battle that was not officially completed, Seoul is an extremely sophisticated town. Samsung and LG use part of these technologies for the Sustainable Cities Index  to become the most self-sustaining city in Asia. In contrast, the limitation of growth has contributed to a rise in congestion in the city. The number of people within the city is restricted to further growth, both inside and outside, and the infrastructural development for cars and public transit has to rise to meet the demand that is already there.\n\nConversely, the limitation of growth in the city led to an increase in congestion. Restricting growth toward inward and upward focuses on the number of individuals in the town, as well as the installation of structures for road cars and public services must meet the demand that exists today. Forward-thinkers aim towards the idealised concept of the \"ubiquitous metropolis\" to become a more sustainable city. Technology is the cornerstone to the omnipresent city idea. Seoul is a global pioneer in digital and open data governance. This comprises a large high-speed network for the Internet. In an omnipresent city, the open flow of data makes it possible for people to assess its influence on the environment and the appropriate measures to be taken to minimise its negative impact. The notion is that urban people may modify their lives in an eco-friendly way by upgrading technological infrastructure. The Personal Travel Assistant system is an example of this in action. This system provides the public transit network with real-time information. It enables users to obtain carbon emission statistics and other green travel alternatives.",
        "8": " . Human health and natural environment\n\nSouth Korea is the first OECD country to have produced an explicit green growth strategy . The President of the Republic of Korea announced that the country would transition to a Low-carbon, Green Growth model to guide long-term economic development over the next half-century .\n\nResearch has proven that green infrastructure and green areas reduce the temperature of the buildings and, as a result, the cities. Which is the most ongoing issue nowadays in the World. But also, the green area cleans the air for breathing which enhance human health . That is the first reason why human health is closely related to the natural environment, and urban green spaces are a source of the natural environment in cities that actively promote and maintain humans' physical fitness and well-being . So, we can suggest that the frequent visit and maximum time consumption in the green environment resulted in positively inhuman physical health.\n\nFigure . Distribution of the Green Growth Budget",
        "9": " . Urban Green Spaces \n\nThis theory was proven by the huge research study undertaken in Daejeon , where about  of the city is designated as green areas, including urban natural forests, neighborhood parks, pocket parks, and children's parks - which is higher than any other major city in the country. Moreover, the researching district is surrounded by several densely forested mountains and shares a boundary with the Daechung dam at its northeast border . The land use/land cover  map of Daejeon is the typical spatial distribution pattern  of large cities in the Republic of Korea, and includes: intensified developed central areas, a mixture of natural and developed areas outside of the city centre, and areas with more vegetation along the city's borders, except for the northern part of the city.\n\nFigure . Zoning of Daejeon \n\nThere is a reason why we can adapt this research to other cities and try to find the solutions for the exploring issues. During a cross-sectional study based on  respondents was proven that Urban green landscapes are well documented for mental well-being as shown in Table . In this researching paper the researchers, according to the Forest Resources Establishment and Management Act in Korea, created the abbreviation UGS which means refers to \"planted and managed forests or trees in urbanised areas for enhancing urban dwellers' health, recreation opportunity, resting, and emotional integrity.\" Based on this definition, UGS may include almost all vegetated spaces in urban\nareas, such as urban parks, street trees, green walls, and amusement parks, which is too broad for urban dwellers. For these reasons, the Korean Forest Service restricted the definition of UGS to \"easily accessible UGS in daily life with minimal time and financial costs.\" In sum, they concluded that there is rich evidence indicating the numerous positive effects of UGS on urban dwellers, such as enhancing physical/mental health, social interactions, and SWB, based on the attention restoration theory, stress reduction theory, and the Biophilia hypothesis . This study examines the effects of frequency of visits and time spent in UGS on the SWB of urban dwellers in Daejeon, Korea. In addition, they investigated the primary motivations and constraints of visiting UGS for heavy, moderate, and light/non-users .\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, they explored the cross-sectional study conducted in South Korea after which they also concluded that green spaces could positively impact social well-being by providing an ideal platform for social interaction . But in this case, the researching interest was focusing on the older part of the population. This study investigated certain sociodemographic characteristics of elderly urban residents, such as their socioeconomic status and health behavior, and the effect of exposure to the urban green areas on mental health concerning stress and symptoms of depression. Therefore, to ensure ongoing improvements in mental health and maintain the mental health of elderly urban residents, it is critically important to give more attention to identifying vulnerable elderly groups and to either construct new urban green spaces or develop suitable nature-based activities that utilise existing resources .\n\nFurthermore, we considered the results of the huge research study on the influence of neighborhoods and around the landscape on the physical and mental human health in Korea. The researchers compared the results of human health diagnostics of citizens from two different residential districts. They tried to realise the reasons for these results and\ntheir connections with the green areas and landscape. So, the users of the Busan UHealthcare centre in the rural area had healthier test readings than those of the Daegu UHealthcare centre, which was surrounded by apartment buildings and commercial business areas. But still, they could not guarantee that only the amount of green zones impacted these results .",
        "10": " . A green city created by its citizens \n\nThe metropolitan city of Seoul has a population of over  million people and continues to grow. At the same time, the quality of life for its residents has been enhanced significantly each year. More than  of the parks \\& landscape of Seoul is forest area concentrated on the outskirts. Thus, the space available for leisure and relaxation during daily life is insufficient, particularly in the city's CBD .\n\nFigure . The increase in Species of Plants and Animal in one district in Seoul near Han River \n\nThe amount of green and park spaces has increased, and include Children's Grand Park in , Yeouido Park transformation  , Seoul Grand Park in , Hangang Park in , World Cup Park in , Seoul Forest in , Dream and Forest Park in northern Seoul in . At the same time, the city government created small parks in neighborhoods and working spaces through the Wall Removal Project in , the Roof Garden Project in , and the School Park Project in . As a result, parks make up a total of  or  of the metropolitan area. By type,  of this area is urban nature parks,  is natural parks,  is neighborhood parks,  is children's parks, and  is reserved for cemetery parks. The impact of this development has also affected animals and plants, as new species emerged . The Parks \\& landscape policies of Seoul are implemented in two axes: ecological conservation and expansion of parks \\& landscape. Seoul created Hangang Park, World Cup Park, Seoul Forest, and Dream Forest Park in northern Seoul, among others, as part of its decision to increase the city's park area, which expanded around   between  and . The share of Seoul made up of park areas increased about  during the same period, from  in  to  in  .\n\nFigure . The transformation of Yeouido Plaza  to Yeouido Park  \n\nCurrently, the government is still focusing on the development of green infrastructure in many parts of South Korea, especially downtown in Seoul. The development of green areas is the part of the  Seoul Plan . Moreover, the government has decided to focus on the development of the green culture around the population and ingrate them to this system. So, in , Seoul introduced a citizen-involved park management system for the creation and management of Seoul Forest where Seoul Green Trust participated in the creation and management of Seoul Forest. Intending to become 'A green city created by its citizens,' Seoul has since applied this new management concept to its urban greening programs. In , the mayor mentioned the idea of having urban parks and green spaces adopted by residents in the Mayor's Hope Diary. The adoption program was introduced the following year, pursued by the Park \\& Green Space Policy Department .\n\nFigure . The main elements of the  Seoul Plan\nThe Korean Government understood the role of green areas a lot of years ago. Currently, in the realm of city-making, three contemporary notions represent the leading values. The three alternative models, however, share the following common objectives:\n\n) To make materialistic progress with less social or environmental harm;\n) To maintain a balance between the three competing values - economic, social, and environmental;\n) The social and environmental aspects are exploring at the same time because it has a strong connection.",
        "11": " . s \n\nMental laxity and stress decreasing, enhanced social cohesiveness and psychosocial links to the homes, a system of immunity advantages, and better physical activity opportunities are the possible causative routes that may lead to green urban spaces. Green infrastructure can also give ecosystem uses linked to extreme heat exposures, and air and noise destruction. There seems to be fairly consistent evidence of health benefits of relaxation, stress management, and other psychological consequences. Many studies have shown that if greenery is near the home, the health advantages of that greenery may provide benefits to health independence and their physical activity level. The health advantages rely on the greenery of residential areas generally and may be supplied via sufficient urban planning procedures. The health advantages of physical exercise in green areas rely on the accessibility of public green areas suited for dynamic recreational and athletic fun. Green areas can also assist in reducing environmental and health disparities by giving equal access to and profit from common surroundings and equitable environmental services like decreasinging noise and air pollution to all population groups."
