        "1": " Biophilic design as an adaptive reuse of the built environment strategy and its impact on people's health and well-being perception \n\nMaria Cacique ",
        "2": " \n\nThis research arises from concern about the existence of abandoned buildings and urban infrastructure, a problem that will increase after the current pandemic, with a negative effect on people's health and well-being. Adaptive reuse through Biophilic design is proposed as an answer for the built environment interventions, and this paper aims to demonstrate its impact through a case study in Taichung, Taiwan and surveys application including the World Health Organization variables and the  Patterns of Biophilic Design. The  revealed a significant increase in the participants' perception of health and well-being after being visually in contact with Biophilic design site.\n\n\nKeywords- biophilic design, built environment, adaptive reuse, paired samples t-test.",
        "3": " \n\nIn a world with increasingly urban sprawl, this current pandemic has exposed deep inequalities and demonstrates that tackling the virus is more challenging in urban areas . This situation is a largely urban problem and certainly its effects will also be reflected in our built environment. According to data from UN-Habitat , as a result of confinement, digital services and teleworking have increased, generating uncertainty about future of buildings such as offices and even homes that could become obsolete. The possibilities of uses are as numerous as evolutionary needs of our cities. If there is one thing that is certain in this pandemic, it is that we must be flexible to react quickly to new urban needs. We have neither the time nor the resources  to build each time from scratch. Adaptive rehabilitation that we have been practicing for centuries takes more and more strength now . And the fact is that, adaptive reuse enables a building to suit new conditions. It is a process that reaps the benefit of the embodied energy and quality of original\nbuilding in a sustainable manner . Thus, adaptive reuse is the sustainable response for an Urban Regeneration  and Post-industrial cities are examples of this, as many of them have succeeded in preserving their vitality through the adaptive reuse of their built environment. According to Browning et al. , the built environment is defined as places and spaces created or modified by people with particular emphasis on buildings, parks, streetscapes, and other spaces that provide the setting for human activity .\nWith all of the above-mentions in mind, it is required that all new measures prioritize and are focused on ecological and sustainability aspects. And the reason is because nature also has unusually potent power to heal broken human landscapes and to humanize and reinvigorate distressed cities and built environments . In addition, incorporating nature into the built environment is not just a luxury, but a sound economic investment in health and productivity, based on well researched neurological and physiological evidence . Regarding this, it is possible to\nsuggest one sustainable strategy designed through Biophilic principles that at the same time have an impact on health and well-being of human beings. Biophilic design promotes ecologically interrelated design solutions and in a multiple scale. The conventional design of built environment has greatly contributed to this crisis. A remedial response to this challenge has emphasized on reducing our environmental impacts through energy and resource efficiency, the use of less polluting materials, recycling, and other important strategies. Yet, this low environmental impact approach, while essential by itself, is insufficient for achieving true and lasting sustainability .\nAuthors such as Beatley  in his book Biophilic City and Design states that urban planners have also rediscovered the importance of city design in advancing health , this one includes mental health and well-being. Then, in addition, with Biophilia, Biophilic design is essential for providing people opportunities to live and work in healthy places and spaces with less stress and greater overall health and wellbeing , and this is how its impact can be explained. According to some authors, one way to enable cities to move towards resilience is through Biophilia . Thus, with Biophilic Urban Design recovery could also be possible to contribute to make healthier and more resilient environments.\nThis paper recognizes the importance of adaptive reuse as a response to the functional obsolescence of buildings; focuses on Biophilic design as a sustainable strategy to address this problem, demonstrating its impact on human health and well-being; and achieves this through the analysis of a case study in Taiwan that has a successful adaptive reuse of the built environment by using Biophilic design elements. Therefore, through the development of online survey that considers variables of World Health Organization and the  Patterns of Biophilic Design , the study focuses on evaluating the perception of users before, during, and after being exposed to Biophilic design and by using Photography as a tool. Through Paired Samples T-test and descriptive statistics, the study proves the positive impact\nof Biophilic design on health and well-being of those who come into contact with it.",
        "4": " \n\nAs a way to demonstrate the impact of Biophilic design in the health and well-being from the people's perception of a site with Biophilic principles, this research combines a qualitative and quantitative method. It is mainly based on a literature review for variables identification, the data collection through surveys, and the application of Paired Samples T-test and descriptive statistics via SPSS for its final analysis and  interpretation. The research process will be explained as follows: Biophilic Design Principles Compilation, Case Study Selection, Online Survey Design, Online Survey Application and Data Collection and Data Analysis in SPSS.\n\nBiophilic Design Principles Compilation: The research process starts with a bibliographic research to identify elements of Biophilic design that could be the basis for structuring this research and to identify its impact on effectively enhancing health and well-being in individuals and society. In the first stage, the  show  patterns of Biophilic design by Terrapin  which were complemented by the experiences described by Interface,  . The importance of patterns included in this research are developed through extensive interdisciplinary research and are supported by empirical evidences and the work of Christopher Alexander, Judith Heerwagen, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, Stephen Kellert, Roger Ulrich, and many others. Over  publications on biophilic responses have been mined to uncover patterns useful to designers of the built environment . Regarding  patterns, they can be grouped into  categories  and each one includes both the design elements that will be taken into account for selecting the case study, as well as the experiences that are intended to be transmitted to users and that will be included in the surveys.\n\nCase Study Selection: Once the design elements were identified, they were applied in the\nselection of a case study. Taichung Cultural and Creative Industries Park  was chosen. This is one of five national-level cultural and creative facilities of Taiwan; the park is located near Taichung Railway Station in the city's South District. TCCIP was built as a distillery in  during Japanese colonial rule . After World War II, the facility was administered by Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau . But in , due to environmental and urban redevelopment considerations, alcohol production was relocated to Taichung Industrial Park; as a consequence,  buildings were abandoned. In , the city government took steps to preserve the unoccupied distillery by designating  of its  buildings as historic structures . After a re-design proposal, the park opened to the public in  and was renamed as The Cultural Heritage Park. It has been emerged as one of Taiwan's most dynamic cultural centers, offering a melange of art, educational, entertainment and historical attractions . It represents a successful case of adaptive reuse of post-industrial buildings and, upon evaluation; it includes elements of each of the Biophilic design patterns in its proposal.\n\nOnline Survey Design: The next important stage was the design of surveys which, because of the current situation and the restrictions due to the pandemic, an online survey was chosen using Google forms with the purpose of evaluating the health and well-being perception of respondents in three important moments: before, during, and after having been exposed to a series of previously selected photographs which represented the  Biophilic design patterns and elements present in the case study. This survey was designed as follows and includes  sections:\n\n- Section : Focusing on data collection such as nationality, gender, age, marital status, occupation, live and their design study . The purpose of this section is\nto profile the respondents and to establish an appropriate connections and guidelines at the moment of analyzing the collected data.\n\n- Section : Using -item World Health Organization Well-Being Index   which is the most widely used questionnaires to assess subjective psychological well-being. Its first publication was in , and has been used in research studies all over the world, this is favorable at this stage, where it is desired to know the condition of respondents in the days prior to being in contact with design elements associated with biophilic patterns.\n- Section : Including an evaluation during a photographic review by respondents. Fourteen representative images were selected, all of them of Biophilic design patterns taken in situ. Each image corresponds to design elements existing in the case study. The purpose of this phase is for respondents to answer about their emotions regarding  variables identified in  Patterns of Biophilic Design. Each emotion was translated into a separate question and was measured on a Likert scale, from  to  , where  represented  strongly disagree,  disagree,  neutral,  agree and   strongly agree.\n- Section : Asking  questions from section  on health and well-being proposed by World Health Organization. Its purpose is to find out if there is a variation with respect to the responses obtained before being in contact with Biophilic design. The differences as well as the relationships established between them will be analyzed with Paired Samples T-test in SPSS.\n- Section : For this last stage of the survey,  questions were developed to inquire about satisfaction and general perception of the design and. As in previous sections, it was also evaluated using the Likert scale.\n\nOnline Survey Application: Once the survey was designed, it was applied online and kept available for two weeks, obtaining a total of  respondents from different countries in Asia, America and Europe. Then, in order to analyze the , the next phase was the data analysis via SPSS, for it was imperative to identify a correct method needed to test our hypothesis: Is there a significant change in individual's health and well-being perception before and after being exposed to a Biophilic design elements? Thus, to achieve this,   were identified: Means analysis which allowed to get the scores of each pattern and Paired Sample T-Test, since this one also contributed to identify if there is a difference in mean scores between the two measurement times: before test and after test. Also, it was possible to identify the most and less representative variables for this study.\nData Collection and Data Analysis in SPSS: For a better understanding, the step-by-step application of both : Means and Paired Samples T-test via SPSS will be explained in detail in the result section.",
        "5": " \n\nA total of  people responded this survey and their profile is shown in Table I.\n\nPROFILE OF THE RESPONDANTS\n\n\nThe  showed the patterns that were best evaluated and which successfully conveyed emotions in the respondents were: Biomorphic forms patterns with a mean of .; Visual connection with nature with ., and nonvisual connection with nature with .; all  patterns are strongly related to visual perception. Since respondents only viewed photos of the site from online survey, it is reasonable that they were the best represented in photographs. The patterns with the lowest\nmean scores were: risk/peril and complexity/order, both with means of . which are related to sensory information, not easy to be represented on an online survey.\n\n PATTERNS OF BIOPHILIC DESIGN\n\n\n.Refuge\n\n\nline photos). This method was explored by comparing means obtained in section  and section , both related to -item World Health Organization Well-Being Index. With this comparison it has been possible to answer our hypothesis and to identify if there was any significant change with regard to the perception of health and well-being of the participants after being exposed to Biophilic design elements, in this context through photos and images.\nThis collected data were grouped into  pairs, each pair containing the same variable but in two different moments, one for \"before\"  and one for \"after\"  as shown in Table III. The  show that the mean difference of both pair  and pair  are not statistically significant at . However, there is an increase between means from . to .  and from . to .  which is not significant but it exists. On the other hand, pairs , , and  are statistically significant at . The  indicate that a significant improvement in the perception of health and well-being in users by increasing their good feelings and emotions related to cheerful and in good spirits, calm and relaxed, fresh and rested. These  are reinforced in the means of these three pairs that increase significantly from . to . , . to .  and from . to . .\n\nAs part of this  obtained, it is observed that there is a correlation between the score that participants gave to each Biophilic design elements  and the variables related to their level of satisfaction demonstrated in section  of the survey. However, patterns  and  stand out since they are not statistically significant at  . . This is because 'Sig. ' or  for absolutely all satisfaction questions, which means that pattern   had no impact on how participants rated any aspects related to spatial design, natural environment or feelings related to the site or to make any decision about visit the case study or recommend it as a good place as well as pattern  (Complexity and\norder: I feel an intriguing balance between being bored and overwhelmed).\nThe correlation of the same  patterns and the impact they had for the participants when answering section  was also analyzed. It is observed that pattern  is the only one that is not statistically significant, in two items of the  analyzed. This is because for both its 'Sig. ' or , which means that this pattern  did not have any influence on respondents to feel cheerful and in a good spirit or to feel that their life is filled with interesting things; in other words, they felt better about these two items but not because of pattern .\n\nHEALTH AND WELL-BEING BEFORE AND AFTER\n\nPair \nBefore-My daily . . - .\nlife has been filled with things that interest me\nAfter-I feel that . . today my life has been filled with things that interest me\n\nFinally, is important to analyze the data in section , which concludes the survey and provides an overview of the respondents' satisfaction regarding to biophilic elements evaluated in this case study. The  are shown in Table IV.\nThe data at this Section was analyzed in SPSS through descriptive statistics. It was possible to confirm that participants feel mostly satisfied with natural environment that they saw in the previous images and less satisfied with things related to spatial design, which is quite interesting, first, because it matches with the patterns best rated \"visual connection with nature\" and \"non-visual connection with nature\". Secondly, it is important because the lowest characteristic rated at this stage was \"I am satisfied with the spatial design shown in previous pictures\", reinforced that, since this research was based on images, it is not possible to visualize the complete space. It is only done in a fragmented way, which limits its understanding and it is demonstrated by the  obtained.\n\nSITE EVALUATION FROM THE RESPONDANTS\n\n\nIf I have a chance I . . would like to visit there\n\nI will recommend my . .\nfriends to make a visit there\n\nAll of the above-mentions can be explained by the fact that since this is an online survey; many items in both patterns can hardly be transmitted through images, but certainly this must be clarified in a further research. Although it is important to emphasize that, even so, through this proposal online, it was possible to demonstrate a significant improvement in the perception of health and well-being of respondents.",
        "6": " \n\nThis research demonstrated the positive impact of incorporating elements of nature into the built environment by registering an increase in the participant's health and well-being perception.\nThis was possible by the design and implementation of an online survey which collected people's perception at two important moments: before and after being exposed to a set of photos and images of a case study with an adaptive reuse that included Biophilic design elements.\nAs a result, those design patterns that had the greatest impact and those that were less satisfactory in the participants' experience were also identified. Specifically, the patterns evaluated that had the higher impact are directly related to the natural environment, so it is necessary to emphasize the importance of environmental design in present and future buildings.\nIt also demonstrates that Biophilic design is ideal as an adaptive reuse proposal for the built environment since the well-designed built environment can be a relief of urban life, as in this case study: The Cultural Heritage Park, a former factory with a successful adaptive reuse with previously identified Biophilic elements.\nIn general terms, the findings imply that having contact with Biophilic design has an impact, as shown in this research, a positive one; on the health and well-being of the individuals.\nThis study has also important implications for Biophilic design. Since the data analysis of the different variables suggest, some identified elements could not be significant and could even be omitted in the design, based on these , since elements from patterns  and  do not necessarily reflect an impact on the health and well-being of individuals.\nAnd this is related to assume a more serious concern about these patterns when we do Biophilic design in the built environment. However, as this research is based on pictures, it is possible that the patterns that have greater significance and are better related to health and well-being will change when conducting the onsite surveys in a further study.\nTherefore, the importance of conducting, under the same principles used in this research, on-site surveys, and consequently compare the  in this paper will certainly contribute even more to highlight the Biophilic design as a solution to increase people's health and well-being and the main patterns involved.\nThis paper's contributions and its importance are not only for people's health and well-being, it is also possible to go further and explore its implications at urban level, identifying its connection with socio-economic and environmental issues and then, with Healthy cities.\nA subsequent research not only is relevant but necessary to continue with a comparison between case studies that will allow for an exhaustive analysis in a diversity of built environments with a variety of adaptive reuse strategies in order to have a deeper understanding of their effects when they experiment higher, lower or null presence of Biophilic design and to identify a major or less health and well-being of individual's perception in every case."
