        "2": " \n\n\nNeuro-architecture\nNeuropsychology\nBuilt environment\nEnvironmental psychology\nCognitive architecture\nLearning environments\nNeuroUrbanism \nThis study explored the role of the built environment of an academic campus in influencing students' perception of mental restoration and well-being, who are constantly at risk of stress and psychological distress. A survey of  college students was conducted to identify activity hotspots on campus, and a neuropsychological study involving mobile EEG and Perceived Restorativeness Scale  was conducted on  students at these hotspots to investigate the role of built environment aspects on restorative approach/neglect behavior and perception of built environment. The study relies on four prominent theoretical constructs in the area, namely Attention Restoration Theory , Stress Reduction Theory , Arousal Theory, and Prospect \\& Refuge Theory, to develop combinatory mechanism-based hypotheses for identifying aspects of a mentally resilient campus builtenvironment. The study's statistical analyses reveal that certain environmental aspects, such as vegetation, novelty/uncertainty, acoustic ambience, and expansive vistas, are positively associated with favourable approach behaviours and normalized average alpha brain waves, while other elements, such as presence of high density of buildings may be related to avoidance behaviours. Greenery and Sky had the most positive relationship with the Normalized Alpha  while the presence of buildings revealed a negative relationship , indicating that a stronger building density was linked to a weaker level of normalized alpha waves. The study also shows that natural components such as grass, sky, and filtered and diffused light boost people's perceptions of an environment's restorative characteristics. The findings of the study have the potential to impact campus design and planning strategies that prioritize student well-being and create more hospitable environments for students to thrive, resulting in improved mental health and academic accomplishment.",
        "3": " . \n\nUniversity and other higher education students are particularly prone to psychological distress and the development or intensification of mental health issues. Academic environments are burdened with high cognitive behavior among students which often causes mental fatigue, stress, and insomnia, when the effects of accumulated stress do not fade out and disappear . In some of the recent studies it has been reported that high levels of stress are linked to lower levels of wellbeing and quality of life in students pursuing higher education degrees. Poor mental health and distress appear to be on the rise in this demographic, with the most reported issues being stress, anxiety, depression, suicide ideation, and sleeplessness symptoms . Institutions have come up\nwith robust redressal and care systems for managing student mental health with broader emphasis on social and economic domains . Social domain includes preventing the substance use such as consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs, while also providing emotional support through counselling and in-campus presence of psychiatry and student psychology experts . The economic domain deals with the relevant health infrastructure required to support mental health activities and the financial circumstances of students which often drive them towards substance use .\n\nThe significance of the neighborhood-built environment to health is also being acknowledged increasingly and growing evidence from longitudinal and cross-sectional studies suggests that a community's structural and social characteristics might have an impact on its inhabitants' mental health . Depression, anxiety, and both physiological and self-reported measures of stress have been found to relate to negative impressions of the built environment  whereas positive perceptions of the built environment are linked to increased levels of approach and access to physical activity, which may lower depression and cardiovascular risk with potential advantages for both physical and mental health . In order to identify the built environment characteristics which can be perceived positively, the relationship between the built environment and its associated restoration and resilience theories along with the comorbidity nexus of stress, anxiety and depression is needed to be reconfigured at both the physiological and neuropsychological level.",
        "4": " .. Stress, anxiety and depression: the comorbidity nexus\n\nWhen an organism perceives or experiences a stressor, which is a threat to its internal balance or homeostasis, a stress response occurs . This reaction is a complex, integrated response that includes both physiological and behavioral changes to help the organism deal with the threat. In humans, the stress response is triggered when the brain detects a stressor in the environment, which is known as an environmental stressor. In contrast, psychological stressors involve anticipated events that could be perceived as a threat, and they add the element of anticipation to the challenge of maintaining homeostasis .\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between stress and anxiety requires acknowledging the importance of anticipation in the stress response. Stress, which is a physiological response to a stimulus, is accompanied by an emotional response. Fear, as defined in the DSM-, is the emotional response to a real or perceived imminent threat, while anxiety is the anticipation of a future threat.\n\nWhen the brain detects a stressor, the adrenal glands stimulate the production of cortisol. Cortisol is a stress hormone or messenger that alerts other organs in the body to the presence of a stressor. Moreover, cortisol also plays a crucial role in regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal  axis and stimulating the body's response to stress . When the HPA axis is repeatedly activated, it may lead to changes in cortisol production and an impaired stress-response system . Chronic stress, which is a prolonged feeling of stress, has been linked to numerous physiological and psychological disorders, including high blood pressure, diabetes, and neuropsychiatric disorders . The experience of stress and anxiety is a normal and adaptive response that\nalerts individuals towards danger in the environment. However, prolonged, or chronic stress or anxiety can have harmful effects on the body and mind. Some environmental stressors which cause long term stress, anxiety disorders such as claustrophobia and resultant depression can be regulated and/or eliminated by the presence of a positively perceived and restorative built environment .",
        "5": " .. Built environments and mental health\n\nBuilt environments  are physical interventions by humans, which provide habitable space and set the stage for human interaction. They consistently affect cognition and our perception of stress and thus help in shaping human responses . Since the establishment of the discipline, environmental psychologists have been able to identify the importance of a series of physical settings in generating favourable cognitive and emotional outcomes , but we still possess very little knowledge of how alterations in a function-dedicated Built Environment may impact cognitive performance and emotional balance. A significant number of studies in built environment and behavior domain have university students volunteering as participants and this number got amplified when the students were stuck in their university campuses under lockdowns of COVID- which provided the researchers with sole opportunity to examine the impact of different built environments on human behavior and mental health through isolation studies. Several studies which analyzed this relationship pointed directly towards positive effect of greenery, sky, and use of biophilic features in design of built environment as a restorative mechanism .",
        "6": " .. Restorative environment: combinatory theoretical framework\n\nMultiple significant theoretical frameworks  have been put forth to explain the restorative and pleasurable effects of natural and built environments in studies on restorative experiences: Attention Restoration Theory  , Stress Reduction Theory  , Arousal Theory  and Prospect and Refuge Theory  . 'Directed attention' is a key concept in ART, which is the deliberate technique of focusing on or concentrating on things or activities while simultaneously blocking off unnecessary stimuli. While ART holds that focused attention is a finite resource that can become exhausted after prolonged and/or vigorous usage, it also contends that some surroundings, particularly natural ones, can help people recover from states of attentional depletion.\n\nART is a theory developed by Rachel and Stephen Kaplan in the s, which proposes that exposure to nature can improve mental fatigue and restore attentional capabilities. This theory contends that routine tasks call for prolonged effort and concentrated attention, which might result in mental exhaustion and poor cognitive function. Nature rich environments provide a restorative effect that helps reduce mental fatigue and increase cognitive performance . This restorative effect is thought to be due to the inherent characteristics of natural environments, such as the presence of soft fascinations, or attention-grabbing stimuli that do not require focused attention, as well as the perceived sense of being away from everyday life and experiencing a sense of connection with nature .\n\nStress Reduction Theory  focuses on people's immediate affective reactions to nature as a cause of restoration. SRT specifically tries to clarify how exposure to nature can help people experience less  stress. SRT explicitly implies that the human species is naturally geared to quickly express positive affect toward natural, vegetation-rich environments. This assumption is based on evolutionary psychology. According to the theory, such a response was adaptive for early humans since it helped their search for sources of food, water, and shelter. According to SRT, modern environments and natural elements still elicit positive affect in people, which may consequently lessen or even buffer psychophysiological stress. As per Arousal theory, people are motivated to seek out situations that are stimulating\n\nenough to maintain their optimal level of arousal. Berlyne proposed that humans have a \"curiosity drive,\" which motivates them to seek out new and complex stimuli that can increase their arousal levels. At the same time, individuals also seek to reduce their arousal level if it becomes too high, as excessive arousal can cause anxiety and stress. The theory has been applied to explain motivation, perception, learning, and creativity . The emphasis on optimal arousal levels in arousal theory is consistent with the notion advanced by ART that natural surroundings provide the ideal mix of novelty and complexity, promoting attention restoration and cognitive function . The prospect-refuge theory  is a theory in environmental psychology that explains people's preferences for certain environments and how their perceptions are influenced by natural environments. The theory, first introduced by Jay Appleton , states that people are attracted to environments that offer both Prospect  and Refuge . The theory suggests that people seek environments that provide them with the opportunity to observe potential danger  while still being able to find a place to take cover  in case of danger. According to the theory, people find landscapes with an appropriate balance of prospect and refuge most attractive and satisfying .\n\nThe future approaches in built environment restorative and stress reduction research should consider a combinatory mechanism-based hypotheses for all four theories discussed above as they together make up the core of the phenomenon targeting 'mentally resilient built environment design' which encompasses cognitive, emotional, and physiological aspects.\n\nThe underlying aspects of Attention restoration, stress reduction, optimal arousal, and psychological comfort are all integral to the restoration experience . Examining all these aspects concurrently offers an enhanced awareness of how the natural environment benefits human mental health. The selected theories have a strong foundation in environmental psychology and have undergone extensive study and practical applications in built environment studies , , . Although each theory emphasizes a different aspect of restoration, they also overlap and reinforce one another. The inter-relationship between SRT, ART and PRT may be seen in how natural settings provide open vistas  and secure spots , which contribute to the\ncharacteristics of psychological restoration. Since Arousal theory and ART both emphasize the value of stimulating environments that draw in an appropriate amount of attention, their interdependency is evident . Natural settings frequently provide both the healing effects of ART and SRT and the uncertainty/novelty from Arousal theory. This interaction facilitates in developing a coherent framework that demonstrates how these various features interact synergistically and represent the holistic idea of restorative environment .\n\nAccording to the integrated framework, exposure to a natural and well-designed environment promotes emotional comfort, appropriate arousal, attention restoration, and a reduction in stress, all of which have positive effects on emotional states. It implies that a healthy environment offers chances for both directed and undirected attention, promoting mental and emotional regrowth. The environment's capacity for restoration is increased by the presence of natural components paired with architectural aspects that provide prospect and refuge. The framework emphasizes how different theories combine to provide a comprehensive knowledge of how the built environment affects emotional well-being. The conceptual framework provides testable hypotheses that anticipate how different elements of the environment and patterns influence emotional response.",
        "7": " .. Perceived Restorativeness Scale \n\nA vital measure at the nexus of numerous well-known ias in the field of environmental psychology is the Perceived Restorativeness Scale  originally developed Hartig and shortened and validated by Pasini et al. . This comprehensive assessment tool connects the Prospect Refuge Theory, the Attention Restoration Theory, the Stress Reduction Theory, and Berlyne's Arousal Theory, illuminating the complex interplay between human perception, emotional well-being, and environmental settings. The PRS supports ART by assessing how much an environment can draw in and hold a person's attention while also promoting mental rejuvenation and cognitive restoration. Similarly, the PRS captures the qualitative elements that promote relaxation, emotional balance, and stress reduction by evaluating coherence, compatibility, and the sense of being away which are aspects of PRS, closely fitting with the principles of SRT . The PRS expands on\nArousal theory by examining how perceived restorativeness of surroundings might promote a healthy balance between mental activity and relaxation, affect emotional states, and contribute to the right amount of arousal. The scale incorporates the ideas of Prospect Refuge Theory by taking into consideration how particular contextual factors, such as coherence and compatibility, contribute to a feeling of security and emotional comfort . The PRS encourages the development of environments that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also supportive of cognitive renewal, emotional rejuvenation, and optimal arousal by empowering researchers, designers, and practitioners to unravel the complex relationships between environmental characteristics and human emotional well-being through this measure. PRS has been widely used in built environment domain studies to capture the associated perception of environmental aspects on restoration .",
        "8": " .. Neuropsychological tools: EEG and its applications in built environment research\n\nSince everyone reacts to stress differently, measuring mental stress can be difficult . Subsequently, the technique used for measurement and analysis affects how accurately mental stress is measured. Traditionally, subjective techniques are used to measure stress. Self-report questionnaires like the perceived stress scale, are the method that is most frequently employed . The  of questionnaires, self-report ratings, and interviews have been validated as the basis for estimating the amount of mental stress in majority of research; but assessments demand the user's complete focus and are subjective. Humans thus aren't always aware of how stressed they are; as a result,  like self-report assessments could produce erroneous stress level measurements. They occur to be significantly less reliable than physiological measures like Heart rate variability , electrodermal activity , electromyogram , blood pressure, pupil diameter, salivary cortisol, and salivary alpha amylase which are among the physiological markers that have been identified as stress indicators.\n\nIn the last two decades, neuroimaging has revealed several brain regions that are active during stress and anxiety responses in healthy individuals, including the hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and nuclei of the brainstem . Within the last decade, the research on the mobility of these brain imaging techniques has advanced to a level where they can be considered for extra-lab studies with minimized apparatus and wireless technology. Most of the development is visible in mobile-EEG segment where several companies have come up with research grade mobile-EEG equipment providing an additional advantage for comparative extra-laboratory devices and competitive cost for variable quantity of both wet and dry electrodes . Electroencephalography  is an exceedingly good temporal resolution technique for neuroscience studies . In comparison to fMRIs that are dependent on blood supply, EEG signals are the outcome of neuronal-assembly synchronous activity that are reliable of being monitored and non-invasive from the scalp's surface. The use of EEG is one of the fastest growing areas of study in cognitive neuroscience in the Built Environment domain because it is portable and dynamic, and it enables study participants to travel when engaged in real physical environments .\n\nResearchers have created several models that use EEG data to estimate stress levels based on changes in brain activity . The resultant neural activity in the brain produces the electrical signals captured by the EEG. These waveforms, which are typically identified by their form, amplitude, and frequency, are captured by electrodes positioned on the surface of the scalp. The hertz  and microvolt ranges are used to measure the frequency and amplitude oscillations in EEG signals, respectively. Each of the five bands—delta , theta , alpha , beta , and gamma —can represent a diverse physiological state of mind determined by the frequency characteristics of the EEG signals . Right hemisphere activity predominates over left hemisphere activity during negative\n\nEEG feature extraction  and associated inferences.\n\n\nemotions, indicating the region for stress detection . Theta and delta bands denote unconsciousness, whereas the alpha and beta bands denote consciousness. The degree of relaxation, perception processing, cognitive demands, and emotions can all be reflected in alpha waves. Beta wave frequencies that are rapidly changing are thought to be a sign of stress. Researchers have used a variety of characteristics and classifiers for EEG-based stress analysis techniques. Frequency band power, alpha band peak frequency, cross-correlation across band powers, and Hjorth parameters, which are time-based EEG waveform characteristics, are the parameters utilized for stress classification . Additionally, the ratio of power spectral densities of alpha and beta waves has been marked as an indicator of physical stress. Stress has been shown to cause changes in EEG absolute power and other connectivity metrics such as coherence. Stress treatment measures have been shown to affect EEG alpha asymmetry .\n\nDevelopmental illnesses and interpatient variance in emotional style and personality traits have all been linked to frontal EEG alpha asymmetry . Major depressive disorder has been linked to higher left alpha asymmetry both at rest and during emotional activities . Higher left frontal activity appears to be associated with approach-related behavior, whereas higher right frontal activity appears to be associated with withdrawal-related behavior . Better emotion management , better stress regulation , and more reward responsiveness have all been associated with higher left-sided frontal activity . Analytical metrics and feature extraction  considering frontal regions of the brain, play an important role in identifying the possible environmental stimuli which may cause a de-stressing effect on the brain as the prefrontal cortex is associated with perceiving the degree of threat and level of stress.",
        "10": " .. \n\nA campus survey was conducted to help us in identifying the perceptive hotspots of students' mental needs while the resultant EEG study looks at compositional elements  of those hotspots to\nunderstand their role in mental restoration. Fig.  illustrates the mechanism of scaling down the built environment for identification of built environment aspects.\n\nThe campus survey introduced the following four questions to the resident student population through a limited time survey to understand how students perceive built environments of campus for different mental restoration needs:\n\nQ. Which is your favorite place on the Campus to hang out with friends?\nQ. Where on the campus would you often go while you take a short break from work/studies?\nQ. Where on the campus would you prefer to go alone after a stressful day?\nQ. Which specific part of the campus you would associate with the most calming and peaceful experience for sitting or for taking a walk?\n\nThese questions were finalized for the survey from a series of similar sets of questions which have come up through several experts with the stake holders including environmental psychologists, institute wellness center staff, resident students, and research team members. The groups began with outlining the daily routine of students and classifying their behavior with respect to the choices they make as per different social and psychological needs. A word cloud with interlinkages was prepared which generated the series of questions which were later refined with each subsequent and finally the four domain questions which can be majorly distinguished from each other were finalized for the survey. The  of campus survey are shown in Fig.  which summarizes the most favored spots  in the campus for the specified mental restoration needs. To prevent the participants from getting fatigued due to excessive walking, eight hotspots  were selected for the resultant EEG study.\n\nA brief description of the landscape features of each of the eight shortlisted hotspot areas is given below:-\n\n- Dhauladhar Circle : . ha of space which is surrounded by elevated levels of earth giving the feeling of a shallow and wide pit with pine trees, few shrubs and a small café at the centre which functions after  PM and attracts students till late night.\n- Open Air Theatre : . ha of space which has an Open-Air Theatre at one end where students practice and perform regularly, on the other end it has sports ground with horizon views of several mountain ranges.\n- Bridge : . ha of space which has a  m long and -mwide metal bridge in the middle of a forest-resembling built environment mostly consisting of Deodar Cedar  with pathways and limited informal seating.\n- Central Library Lawn : . ha of mowed-grass space with shrubs, which is designed as the promenade to the library with few benches available in the grass area for seating which provides the framed view of snow clad Dhauladhar range of mountains through the other institution buildings with green-coloured pitched roof.\n- AMUL : . ha of mowed-grass space attached to a day canteen with movable seating, mostly surrounded by retaining walls and other institutional buildings in the vicinity.\n- Verka : . ha of earth-covered space attached to another day canteen surrounded by a green retaining wall on one end and a see-through metal fence on the other end which provides the semirestricted cliffside view of Hamirpur town below it.\n- Student Park : . ha of pit style designed park clad and paved with red granite stone and mowed grass surrounded by department building blocks on  sides; pathways and retaining walls on the other side attached to a small café in the corner.\n- Admin Backyard : . ha of space with mowed grass and shrubs which is although very small yet provides unrestricted view of snow clad Dhauladhar range of mountains and the valley before it.",

Hypotheses\n\nBased on the combinatory theoretical framework of attention restoration, stress reduction, novelty/uncertainty, and Prospect \\& Refuge in certain environments, which states that the built environment has a significant impact on our emotional states, we proposed four set of hypotheses  which are being tested in this study and are graphically demonstrated in Fig.  along with associated variable types and appropriate statistical tests.",

Location and participants\n\nThe study was conducted in an institute of National Importance which is situated in the Shivalik range of Himalayas in the state of Himachal Pradesh at an altitude range of  from mean sea level. Participants were approached for the EEG study through advertisements at the institute cafeterias and hostel common rooms. Sample size was determined using G Power  toolkit following which a total of  participants  were recruited for the EEG study from the campus . All participants were between the ages of  and   and provided informed consent to participate in the study. The participants came from engineering s and all the participants were undergraduate students and were enrolled full-time at the time of the study. The experiment involves an initial self-report screening for Depression, Anxiety and Adult ADHD using CES-D, GAD-, and ASRS- respectively as per DSM- standards , this is done to exclude cognitive interference arising from mental health issues in participants. Additionally, no participants reported any history of neurological or\n\n\n\nHypothesis being tested in the study with their explanation.\n\n\npsychiatric disorders and addictions.",
        "13": " .. Psychophysiological data acquisition and processing\n\nIn the resultant EEG study, the participants were taken to the above described eight most preferred spots  where EEG in conjunction with a set of self-reported point scales is used\nto assess the participant's approach and neglect behavior in the calculation of neurophysiological impacts. The participants also recorded their brain waves in an indoor room facing a white wall which is developed as a Control Environment .\n\nThe participant's eye state affects the quantity of EEG alpha activity in the brain. When eyes are closed compared to open, EEG alpha activity is more apparent in healthy individuals. It is believed that this decrease in alpha activity corresponds to an increase in the optical system's activity, which is triggered after the eyes are opened and visual input has been received . To balance the effect of visual stimuli on built environment perception in the EEG dataset, a baseline is created for each participant at each spot with  s  eyes open and  s  eyes closed as explained in Fig.  which demonstrates the graphical protocol of the study.\n\nThe participant initially spent  s  settling down and acknowledging the physical environment, then the next  s  of EEG activity was recorded for environmental stimuli. The use of  s  for environmental stimuli has been previously validated in EEG study by Herman et al.,  . EEG data were collected using Muse EEG headbands . The Muse headband  is a research-grade EEG device with four dry electrodes (AF, AF, TP and\n\n\nSample size calculation using G Power . toolkit.\n\n\nAdopted Sample Size\n\n\nTP) that record activity from the anterior-frontal and temporo-parietal region of the brain. The device has been validated for use in research settings and has shown to provide reliable and valid measures of EEG activity .\n\nEEG data were recorded using the Muse Monitor application, with a sampling rate of  Hz . To control for already existing negative emotional stimuli, the International Short Version  of Positive\nand Negative Affect Schedule  was used by the participants to record their responses before the start of the experiment. The IPANAS-SF is a  -item self-report questionnaire that measures positive and negative affect and has been shown to have good reliability and validity. The positive affect includes interested, excited, strong, enthusiastic, and proud emotions while the negative affect includes distressed, upset, guilty, scared, and hostile emotions .\n\n\nAt the  of each environment interaction, the participants were asked to record their responses on the previously mentioned Perceived Restorativeness Scale -  , and their recorded data was attached to their hotspot code. The experiment also recorded deviation in a few extraneous aspects of Outdoor Environment Quality i.e., Temperature and humidity, for control and comfort of participants.\n\nEEG data was preprocessed using the MuseMonitor software package  and the EEGLAB toolbox developed by Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience at University of California  for MATLAB . Power spectral density  values were calculated for the delta , theta , alpha , beta , and gamma  frequency bands. The collected mobile-EEG data went through several stages of processing and visualization as shown in Fig. . The st stage begins with the reception of raw EEG signal in the receptor computer/tablet running MUSE Monitor software which saves recorded data as file followed by file transfer to respective software suite of EEGLAB MATLAB and MUSE Monitor which perform the nd stage of bandpass filtering, where only certain frequencies are selected from the raw data and the rest are rejected. Independent Component Analysis  is done at the rd stage where multivariate signals disintegrate into subcomponents turning them independent in nature. The th stage deals with noisy EEG segments where underperforming or bad data electrodes are removed from the selection.\n\nFrontal alpha asymmetry  scores were calculated as the natural logarithm of the alpha power measured at the right frontal electrode  minus the natural logarithm of the alpha power measured at the left frontal electrode  with the following equation :\n\nTopographic maps  of EEG activity were generated from the data of each participant to visually verify the FAA conditions. Fig.  shows a typical EEG topographic map of a participant at two different hotspots with frequency in hertz  on horizontal axis and Power Spectral Density in microvolts squared per Hertz  on the vertical axis.

Greenery, Sky, and Buildings were shown to be statistically significant predictors of FAA in the multinomial logistic regression model. In the Left category, Greenery and Sky had the strongest positive relationships with FAA. Buildings and FAA in the Left category also exhibited a favourable association, albeit it was less significant. Environmental category, novelty/uncertainty, auditory ambience, and wide vistas were shown to be positively linked with normalized average alpha in the linear regression model, whereas refuge had a minimal influence.\n\nThe chi-square test for He revealed that there was a statistically significant correlation between the FAA and all BEVs, with the exception of reflections, grass, clouds, direct light, filtered and diffused light, arches, vaults, and domes, and natural materials in visible architecture. The substantial correlation between the remaining BEVs and FAA, a measure of emotional state and emotion regulation, shows that these BEVs may be involved in modifying FAA. The moderate connection seen in the chi-square test indicates that although there is not a particularly high correlation between the variables, it is still statistically significant.\n\nThe majority of the BEVs in Hc exhibited a modest correlation with PRS, with the exception of water, reflections, buildings/architecture, and auditory: presence of natural sounds. Both the chi-square test and Fisher's exact test demonstrated a significant association between PRS and most BEVs. The findings imply that the BEVs may have a rehabilitative impact on people's perspectives, as shown by the PRS. The findings specifically show that natural elements like grass, shrubs, trees, greenery, sky, contours and levels, natural light, filtered and diffused light, light and shadow, botanical motifs, shells and spirals, egg, oval, and tubular forms, rocks, stones, and pebbles, as well as natural material and natural texture in visible architecture, significantly improve people's perceptions of how restorative an environment is.\n\nOverall, the findings indicate that the physical environment affects both approach and avoidance behaviours, with good approach behaviours being related with natural aspects like greenery and wide vistas, whereas avoidance behaviours may be connected with buildings and a lack of shelter.\n\nAlthough the  show that the presence of buildings are negatively influencing the perceived Restorativeness potential and positive approach behavior, it is also to be noted that not all building presence should be treated as negative, as the hotspots of OAT, CLL and SPK with  and  presence of buildings respectively , reflect considerably higher PRS scores  and normalized alpha  and positive approach . This finding suggests that the restoration potential and psychological resilience of the current built environment can be enhanced in tandem by a deliberate alignment of buildings with the natural surroundings, involving careful consideration of building form, choice of materials, and complementary colour selection, along with the provision of appropriate prospect and refuge elements.\n\nThe findings imply that some BEVs may have a considerable influence on people's emotional states and experience of Restorativeness. To replicate the  across different groups and conditions, however, and to demonstrate the causal link between BEVs and emotional state or perception of Restorativeness, further research is required. In summary, these findings may have implications for the development of interventions aimed at increasing alpha brainwave activity, such as mindfulness or relaxation techniques, because they imply that creating\nrestorative environments  may also be a promising avenue for promoting alpha brainwave activity.",

Strength \\& limitations\n\nThis study is distinctive in that it uses neuropsychological techniques like EEG and uses a combinatory restorative theoretical framework to investigate the part that built environment aspects play in fostering student well-being on an academic campus. The built environment characteristics and their biophilic components were identified and measured by the study using quantitative techniques like colour segmentation and the BEVs inventory. The selected sample size has a consistent effect size and power, the use of high temporal resolution EEG as well as other quantitative  makes it suitable and wellbalanced selection which might give important insights into the participants' emotional and neurological activity. The  of this study have consequences for the well-being of students and other inhabitants as well as for the design of academic campuses and other physical environments. The study concentrated primarily on the built environment aspects found in academic campuses and did not take into account other factors that may influence student well-being, such as social support or personality traits. Although if efforts were taken to account for potential confounding factors like the time of day and the weather, it's still possible that other unmeasured factors may have had an impact on the outcomes. A cross-sectional approach was used in this study, which limits the capacity to make causal inferences or assess changes over time.\n\nWhile this study has certain limitations, it gives valuable insights into the potential benefits of adopting the aspects of combinatory restorative theoretical framework into academic campuses to increase student wellbeing. The study's findings can be used to guide future research in this area and to design future academic campuses and other physical settings.",
        "24": " . \n\nThis study presents plausible evidence of the influence of the built environment on people's perceptions, behaviours, and well-being. The  imply that built environment features like lack of refuge or the presence of buildings might cause avoidance behaviours, whereas natural components like greenery, wide-open views, and natural light can encourage positive approach behaviours and improve emotional regulation. The study's strength is in how it identifies and quantifies the biophilic elements of the built environment using quantitative approaches and neuropsychological tools like EEG. To demonstrate causal linkages and reproduce the findings across other locations and demographics, additional investigation is required due to the study's limitations, including its cross-sectional methodology and emphasis on academic campuses. Overall, this study highlights the significance of designing spaces that support human health and demonstrates that a biophilic approach to built environment design can have considerable positive benefits on student well-being. This study utilized a neuropsychological approach to understand the compositional elements of a built environment while there are other relevant approaches including social and economic perspectives which can be separately explored by the researchers of those disciplines to distinguish the non-built environment indicators at play. This study primarily focused on the presence of Built Environment aspects as it evaluated the activity hotspots of students, the future studies could look at a model analysis where the built environment aspects can be tested and controlled virtually for their quantity such as in Virtual Reality using head mounted displays ."
