        "1": " Effects of the built environment on residents' subjective well-being and behaviours: a case of Hangzhou, China ",
        "2": " \n\nMetropolises in China are undergoing rapid suburbanization processes, resulting in spatial differences in the built environment from the city centre to the outer suburbs. The continuous suburbanization has changed residents' subjective well-being and behaviours. The association between built environment and subjective well-being has been studied extensively, but there is scarce research on the influence of the built environment on both subjective well-being and behaviours with regards to the self-selection effect in the suburbanization process. This paper constructs an analytical framework to simulate the impacts of the built environment on subjective well-being and behaviours. The propensity score matching method is applied to questionnaire data from Hangzhou in  to investigate these impacts. The  of this research show that in three selected districts, the mean score difference for fitness and social behaviour is quite significant , whereas the mean score for subjective well-being is . . Both fitness and social behaviours are significantly and positively related to subjective well-being. Fitness behaviour has a greater impact than social behaviour. The four dimensions of built environment impact on both subjective well-being and behaviours after self-selection were controlled using the propensity score matching method. The  of the study can inform local governments; exurban development zones should be equipped with more high-end public facilities and public transportation in order to improve residents' quality of life in the suburbanization process.\n\n\n Built environment  Subjective well-being  Behaviours  Suburbanization  Self-selection effect",
        "3": "   \n\nThe built environment describes the objective and subjective features in the physical setting in which people spend their time . In most academic literature, the built environment is defined based on five dimensions: density, diversity, design aesthetics, accessibility and urban form . Research assessing the association between the built environment and people's daily activity outcomes has been growing, mostly in developed countries. The consensus amongst the studies is that the built environment alters and shapes how people engage in physical, social and commuting behaviours . The built environment is also directly related to people's subjective well-being  . As has been found in the literature, individual behaviour impacts SWB . However, does the built environment affect SWB through individuals' behaviour? This indirect effect of the built environment on SWB has rarely been studied.\n\nSuburbanization is a stage of the urbanization process in which the population, jobs and service trades decentralise from inner cities to suburban areas . Suburbanization is characterised by the abandonment of city center in favour of more peripheral locations . In the four decades since reform, China has undergone a rapid urbanization process. Furthermore, metropolises have experienced the suburbanization of an expanding urban area in this process. Suburbanization greatly changed the urban form in urban China; moreover, it caused differences in the landscape from the city centre to the suburbs . In this process, metropolises develop into a spatial pattern with a functional combination of old city zones, new city zones and exurban development zones, which are different in built environment . Continuous suburbanization has greatly changed the lives of residents and affected their well-being. However, few studies have explored how the diverse built environments resulting from suburbanization are related to SWB. It is important to answer this question to improve the quality of suburbanization in China.\n\nThe built environment in which people live is not randomly selected; residential selection is influenced by individual characteristics, behavioural preferences, living habits and other factors . For example, residents who like physical exercise may choose to live in communities near fitness facilities, which will further promote their well-being. In this case, it may be the individual preference, rather than the built environment per se, that encourages frequent fitness behaviour. Thus, the impact of the built environment on satisfaction is affected by an individual's choice of living location, which may lead to differences in the impact of the built environment on satisfaction. However, this self-selection effect has not often been explored in existing research. Therefore, the impact of the built environment on behaviour or SWB is not well understood.\n\nThis paper attempts to bridge these research gaps by exploring the effect of the built environment on residents' SWB and behaviour using the propensity score matching method . In the sections following, we first construct a theoretical framework that simulates the effects of the built environment on SWB and behaviour. In the empirical analysis, using the data from a questionnaire survey conducted in Hangzhou in , we compare the spatial differences in SWB and behaviour in different zones of the city. Subsequently, the relationship between SWB and behaviour is analysed using multiple regression models. Finally, in order to control for the self-selection effect, PSM technology\nis used to investigate the effect of the built environment on SWB/behaviour. In particular, this paper addresses two questions: Are SWB/behaviour among functional areas with different built environments on the same level? And, to what extent does the difference in SWB depend on the built environment ? In this paper, we specifically focus on two types of daily behaviours that are closely related to both SWB and the built environment: social and fitness behaviours.\n\nThis research contributes to previous studies in two aspects. First, individual's selfselection of their living environment is controlled when we simulate the impact of the built environment on SWB and behaviours. If the self-selection effect is ignored, the regression coefficient that is obtained by simply comparing the SWB of the residents in the two groups will not be statistically consistent. This is because the traditional ordinary least squares  regression based on independent random assumptions is not applicable to endogeneity problems, e.g., reverse causality and missing variables . In addition, the linear hypothesis and multicollinearity of the OLS also lead to biased estimations. In this paper, we employ PSM to control self-selection and solve the above problems. Second, we not only explore the influence of the built environment on residents' holistic appraisal of their quality of life, but also examine the association among SWB, behaviours, and the built environment within the context of rapid suburbanization.\n\nThe content of this article is as follows. In the second section, we review the related research both theoretically and empirically. Then, Sect.  provides a theoretical framework to simulate the relationship between the built environment and SWB. The data, variable specification and methodology are introduced in the research design. Following this, we report the empirical findings. Section  contains a brief  and.",
        "4": "  \n\nSWB, which refers to an individual's cognitive and affective evaluations of their own life, is a perceived indicator of welfare that covers many dimensions of life . SWB varies between individuals with different demographic characteristics. Socioeconomic attributes, such as marital status, family income, education level and employment, are also closely related to SWB . Recent studies have assessed the association between people's daily activity and SWB. Physical activity, which contributes to health by preventing disability, morbidity and mortality, is one of the key strategies for improving SWB . Social relationships can be seen as resources for people to fulfil their needs; therefore, social activity has been shown to be positively associated with SWB . Lu and Gilmour  find that the well-being of Chinese people relies on social activity to a greater extent than Western people. The positive effect of social activity on SWB is more significant for migrants than local residents because social networks are a primary source of information about job opportunities and life experiences for migrants, especially for rural migrants . A study by Wang and Li  finds that in the process of suburbanization, migrants are forced to move to exurban areas, which damages their social networks, hence reducing well-being. Moreover, commuting as part of people's daily lives also affects SWB .\n\nRecent studies in geography have explored the relationship between the built environment and SWB. The majority of research has focused on how one or more dimensions of the built environment impact SWB, with studies on density the most extensive. Contrary\nto the  of earlier studies that show that density dimension tends to negatively affect SWB due to overcrowding , later scholars argue that high density area often means high accessibility to destinations, which encourages work and leisure activities, presumably enhancing life satisfaction . The association between the accessibility dimension and SWB has also been studied. Empirical research in the case of Australian cities found that proximity to green space favours well-being . A study on seniors citizens in the UK finds that proximity to open space is positively associated with SWB . In addition, the accessibility of public facilities is also found to be related to residents' subjective evaluation of living conditions . In terms of the design dimension, the pedestrian environment affects well-being as a result of street connectivity and walking safety. Poor street connectivity often means low accessibility to destinations, particularly for car users. Therefore, its effect on life satisfaction is negative . A study by Parra et al.  finds that perceived walking safety is associated with higher SWB. Mixedness or diversity dimension has both positive and negative impacts on SWB. Shafer et al.  indicated the positive association between land use mix and the quality of life in Texas. However, Cao investigated the relationships between land use and life satisfaction and found that the land use mix was positively associated with both accessibility and nuisance and, as a result, the total effect of the land use mix on satisfaction was insignificant .\n\nThe impact of the built environment on individuals' behaviour is increasingly studied, and scholars have particularly focused on residents' behaviour in terms of fitness, commuting, social and recreational activities . An appropriate built environment can be an effective approach to encourage physical activity. For example, Frank et al.  assessed how physical activity is related to the physical environment while controlling for individuals' sociodemographic attributes; and found that the land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density are positively related to the duration of moderate physical activity per day. Oakes et al. , argued that people living in a built environment with a high population density tend to report more frequent physical activity due to the close economic links between a high population density and mixed land use. Road or network connectivity is also significantly associated with activities such as walking and cycling . Regarding the link between social behaviour and the attributes of the built environment, Mazumdar et al.  proved that both destination accessibility and neighbourhood design are positively related to social behaviour whereas the impact of population density is unclear. In addition, access to recreation facilities  encourages leisure activities . In contrast, a recent study by Porter et al.  proved that although there is a relationship between built environment attributes and cycling as a form of transport, the effect of the built environment on recreational cycling is insignificant.\n\nPeople's needs and preferences vary; therefore, they choose to live in a specific built environment that is consistent with their preferences, rather than randomly finding houses on the market. This selection process can bias the estimation of the main effect of the built environment on SWB . This is known as the problem of selfselection bias. It is the bias introduced by the selection of individuals, groups or data for analysis in such a way that proper randomization is not achieved. Consequently, the sample obtained is not representative of the population intended to be analysed . A limited number of studies control for self-selection bias in empirical analysis. For example, based on a survey in California, Handy et al.  answered the question of whether self-selection explained the observed associations. They considered the possible influences\n\nof travel attitudes and neighbourhood preferences when they explored the relationship between the built environment and walking behaviour. They found that the built environment is significantly related to walking behaviour, even when the attitudes and preferences are controlled. Cao  applied propensity score stratification to reduce selection bias in his study that explored the influence of the neighbourhood environment on walking behaviour and found that the causal effects of the neighbourhood environment may be overstated by  for utilitarian walking frequency and  for recreational walking frequency, if residential self-selection is ignored. In addition, instrumental variables are also used to address the self-selection problem .",
        "5": "   \n\nInspired by existing studies that analyse the association between the built environment and residents' lives under the framework of the self-selection effect , this paper builds a theoretical framework  to simulate the effect of the built environment on residents' SWB and behaviours during the suburbanization process in metropolises of China.\n\nFigure a displays the formation of the individual differences in the built environment. First, the built environment has changed dramatically during the suburbanization process in metropolises of China . More importantly, there are spatial differences of the built environment between the city centre and the suburbs. Second, as a result of the housing market reform, residents can freely choose their housing in a city. Residential selection behaviour is influenced by individual preferences. For example, some people prefer to live in the suburbs, with pleasant natural environments, while others prefer the convenience of the city centre. Therefore, disparities in living environment are formed. Individuals who live in an ideal built environment are more satisfied with life. In this case, the impact of the built environment on SWB is affected by the individual's choice of the built environment, which may lead to differences in a model's estimation of the impact of the built environment on SWB. Here, this is referred to as the self-selection effect.\n\nThe relationships between social/fitness behaviour and SWB are shown in Fig. b. A steady social life is beneficial to mental health and can increase SWB. Regular exercise,\nsimilarly, is beneficial for both physical and mental health, and health contributes to SWB. Individual fitness/social behaviours and SWB are influenced by individual attributes.\n\nFigure c depicts the direct and indirect impacts of the built environment on SWB. In terms of the direct effect, as summarised above, the dimensions of the built environment have an effect on residents' daily lives and therefore directly influence residents' subjective evaluation of life. The indirect effect works through individual behaviour. The built environment influences how often individuals exercise and socialise. Social spaces in built environments, such as cafes, pubs, and parks, are the primary location for social behaviours. Abundant and high-quality social spaces encourage social behaviours. Similarly, the fitness fields and sport facilities in a built environment, such as gyms, green spaces, and running tracks, are conducive to stimulating fitness behaviours and improving health. In this way, the built environment affects SWB indirectly through influencing social and fitness behaviours.\n\nIf individuals who like fitness/social activities live in an ideal built environment, they might feel satisfied. However, if individual built environment is inconsistent with their preference, they might feel dissatisfied. Therefore, the impact of the built environment on fitness/social behaviour is affected by individual preference. This self-selection may influence SWB because satisfaction with the built environment might result from whether the residential preference is satisfied rather than built environment per se. Due to the selfselection effect, the influence of the built environment on social/fitness behaviour and SWB may be unclear. In order to avoid self-selection bias, this paper uses the PSM method to control the self-selection effect and then simulates the real impact of the built environment on SWB.",
        "7": " . \n\nHangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, is selected as a case study. During the last four decades, Hangzhou has rapidly urbanised. The total registered population of the city grew from . million in  to . million in . The permanent population was . million with an urbanization rate of  in . In addition, Hangzhou has experienced extensive suburbanization, especially since  ; and approximately  of the sub-districts  in the city centre have experienced dramatic population decline. Suburbanization has resulted in spatial heterogeneity of the built environment in different areas of Hangzhou. In order to capture the diversity of built environments, three types of district, namely Xihu, Qianjiang and Xiasha districts, were selected as survey areas .  Xihu is located in the old city zone and it has been the centre of Hangzhou since before the founding of China in . In the first round of the Hangzhou Master Plan , Xihu was officially identified as the city centre. After years of construction and development, Xihu has now become the old city zone, and the typical landscape is old houses and narrow roads. The new city zone is beginning to shift to the south and the core area is Qianjiang. According to the Hangzhou Master Plan\n\n\n:     Note that the districts here are regions that consist of several subdistricts rather than administrative districts.\n\n, Qianjiang is the municipal government's developmental strategy of transforming from the \"West Lake Era\" to the \"Qiantang River Era\". Consequently, Qianjiang is being oriented as the new political, economic and cultural centre of Hangzhou. The landscape of new city zones is characterised by high rise buildings and wide roads. Xiasha is located in an exurban development zone more than  kms away from the city. In the Hangzhou Master Plan , Xiasha was planned as a national economic and technological development zone located in the suburbs east of the city, which have been built since the late s. This zone is being oriented as a base of the manufacturing industry. Given the population growth and industrial development of the last two decades, the original rural area has transformed into an urban area. The common landscape here is factory plants and residential buildings.",
        "8": " . \n\nData at the individual level was obtained through a field survey conducted in . The survey targeted people who had lived in Hangzhou for at least six months. In each district, neighbourhoods were randomly selected, with residents then invited to participate in the survey at random. The survey recorded information on participants' demographic and socioeconomic attributes, fitness and social behaviours, and subjective evaluations of life. More than  questionnaires were issued with  complete responses received, which forms our dataset. Data that describe the built environment are separately taken from the sixth census , Baidu Map  and registered enterprise information from the Hangzhou Administration for Industry and Commerce .\n\nSubjective evaluation of quality of life is used to measure SWB, which is based on the survey question: \"All things considered, do you feel happy with your life?\" The participants\nare required to answer the question on a -point scale, with  being \"very happy\" and  being \"very unhappy\". Most of the participants  were happy  with life, and  reported a fair happiness level. Less than  of the respondents were unhappy  with their life. Regarding fitness behaviour, the majority of the respondents  engaged in physical exercise weekly, and onethird of them exercised more than five times a week. Approximately  of the respondents engaged in physical exercise monthly, and  reported a fitness frequency less than once per month. Regarding social behaviour,  of the respondents met friends every week, and approximately half  met friends more than once per month. Almost one-fifth of the respondents  met friends every two months, and less than  report a social frequency of every year or even less.",
        "9": " .  \n\nThe descriptive statistics of the variables are presented in Table . The three dependent variables are: SWB, fitness behaviour and social behaviour. Individual attributes namely: age, gender, household income, education, marital status and household registration  are used as confounding variables.\n\nThe suburbanization process can be divided into five stages, in no fixed order: population, manufacturing industry, business, office industry and living space . Suburbanization changes the built environment in urban areas. A single index such as population is often used to measure the degree of suburbanization. However, a single index focus may neglect the spatial difference in different dimensions of the built environment in the suburbanization process. In this paper, eleven indicators from four dimensions are used to measure the change in the built environment in the five stages of suburbanization.\n\nFirstly, population density is used to describe the urban density dimension. Then, the accessibility of city centre and public facilities, including shopping malls, municipal parks, subways, and bus stations, is used to describe the spatial accessibility dimension. In terms of the diversity dimension, the percentages of registered manufacturing, business and office enterprises in the district are measured, with respect to all enterprises in the city. Finally, road connectivity and road density are used to as an indicator for the design dimension.",
        "10": " . \n\nAs presented in the theoretical framework, people choose a built environment according to their needs and preferences. Therefore, the observed difference in SWB/behaviour outcomes is confounded by self-selection. This will lead to a biased estimation of the treatment effect of the built environment on SWB/behaviour. To reduce the bias, we match the samples into groups based on demographic characteristics and then compare the SWB/ behaviour between samples living in different built environments . This is the basic principle of PSM. It is a matching method that estimates the impact of a treatment by accounting for the covariates that predict receiving the treatment .\n\nWe simplify the research problem in this paper by using PSM to solve this self-selection bias. It is assumed that there are only two types of built environment: high-accessibility areas and low-accessibility areas. We also assume that SWB/behaviour is confounded by a single variable: age. For a resident under the age of  who lives in a high-accessibility\n\n\nPopulation density is the population per square kilometre in the sub-district where the responds live. Yanan Road is selected as city centre according to Hangzhou Urban Master Plan . Office industry involves finance, insurance, business service, culture and art, scientific research, news, broadcast, television and film industry. Age categories are recoded from  to  corresponding to the increase of age bands.\nIncome categories are transformed to a continuous variable using the midpoints of each income band, and further converted to natural logarithm\n\n\n\nThe numbers in bold indicate that the variable has the greatest load on the principal component factor\narea , their match will be a resident under the age of  who lives in a lowaccessibility area . The purpose of PSM is to find a nearly \"identical\" observation in the control group as in the treatment group. This matching process is roughly equivalent to one of two \"identical\" observations being assigned to the treatment group and the other to the control group. We then compare the differences between the two to derive the effect of the accessibility treatment on SWB/behaviour. In this paper, SWB/behaviour is confounded by several other variables, so when the treatment group differs from the control group on many characteristics, the match should be based on a scalar that integrates all the characteristics . By matching the participants, we simulated and assessed the effectiveness of the built environment and reduced the deviation caused by confounding variables by comparing the  of treated and untreated participants .\n\nBecause of the association between the eleven variables measuring the built environment, data dimension reduction via principal component analysis  is used to eliminate information overlap. Table  displays the rotated component matrix. Four principal component factors  were screened out and the cumulative rotation sums of the squared loadings was . The four PCF dimensions: land use density, industrial modernization, facility accessibility and travel convenience, are used as explanatory variables in the following PSM method. In order to conduct PSM, respondents with PCF scores larger than the median are classified as the treatment group in this paper. Therefore, respondents who live in the built environment characterised by high land use density/high industrial modernization/high facility accessibility/high travel convenience are identified as the treatment group. Otherwise, the respondents with PCF scores lower than the median were categorised as the control group.\n\n\nGenerally, PSM starts with a logistic regression to predict the probability, i.e., propensity score, of participants being classified in the treatment group. We predict the probability of respondents living in the built environment characterised by high land use density/industrial modernization/facility accessibility/travel convenience using a binary logistic model. . denotes group membership, treatment vs. control group. The probability of choosing the treatment group is expressed as:\n\n\nP\\left=\\frac{\\exp \\left}{+\\exp \\left}\n\n\nwhere  is a vector of independent variables and  is the coefficient vector including an intercept term that needs to be estimated.\n\nBased on the propensity score, a sample in the treatment group was matched to one or more samples in the control group when the propensity scores of the samples in the two groups were close. In the process, samples with extreme propensity scores are removed. Three types of matching , nearest neighbour matching, radius matching and kernel matching, are used in this study to obtain robust . A balance test was performed to ensure that there was no significant difference in the confounding variables between the two groups after matching, so as to obtain a sample distribution that was similar to a random experiment. The average treatment effects on treatment  of the four dimensions was calculated by comparing the difference in SWB/fitness behaviour/social behaviour in the two groups after matching. When one dimension of the built environment is introduced as an explanatory variable, the other three dimensions are controlled for as confounding variables. Overall, there were four quasi-experiments performed in this study in which we set SWB, fitness behaviour and social behaviour as dependent variables, respectively. In the PSM analysis of SWB, the influences of both behaviours were controlled for as confounding variables.",
        "12": " . \n\nResidents' SWB among the three districts is compared . The difference in SWB among the three districts is small. Residents living in Qianjiang report the highest level of happiness , while the percentage of unhappy residents is largest in Xiasha . We also compare the spatial differences of fitness and social behaviours. The percentages of residents who engage in physical exercise regularly  are higher in Xihu and Qianjiang , than in Xiasha . In addition, residents living in Xiasha report a higher probability  of infrequent exercise  than residents living in Xihu and Qianjiang . Although the percentage of residents with frequent social activity  in the three regions is almost equal , more residents living in Xihu report a higher percentage  of fair social activity  than those living in Qianjiang and Xiasha , and the probability of infrequent social activity is the greatest in Xiasha .\n\nThe spatial differences in residents' SWB and behaviours may be explained by the spatial heterogeneity of the built environment in which people live. Xihu, located in an old city zone, is characterised by diverse service facilities, convenient public transport, high accessibility and diverse employment opportunities. Another prominent advantage of Xihu is its proximity to the West Lake Scenic Area, which is a site of natural and cultural heritage. This is advantageous to residents because their leisure time can be more varied, which favours residents' SWB. Qianjiang is the location of advanced industries and high-quality service facilities. Therefore, residents enjoy a relatively good quality of life. However, it is noteworthy that the blocks in the new city zone are usually larger than those in the old city zone, which reduces road connectivity and walkability. Furthermore, fewer bus stations will be established . In Xiasha, because the local government focuses on the development of industry, the quality of the living environment lags behind residents' demands. In addition, the long distance from Xiasha to the city centre leads to home-work separation and lengthy daily commuting for residents and increases the time and monetary costs of maintaining social connections . Therefore, respondents from Xiasha report the lowest SWB and social behaviours in this study.",
        "13": " .  \n\n\n\n*significant at  significant at  significant at . Standard errors are in brackets. Default categories are male, senior high school and below, local registered household\n\n\n\n*significant at  significant at  significant at . Standard errors are in brackets. Nearest neighbour matching, radius matching and kernel matching are three types of PSM \nbehaviours on SWB between migrants and local residents. The  show that there was no significant difference in the impacts of physical exercise activity on SWB between the two groups. In addition, the frequency of social activities has more influence for migrants than local residents, implying that migrants' SWB is more sensitive to social behaviour. This is because social networks are a primary source of information about job opportunities and life experiences for migrants, especially for rural migrants , so their happiness depends more on social connections.",
        "14": " .  \n\n\nThe second quasi-experiment tests the association between industrial modernization and SWB and behaviours. The relationship between industrial modernization and SWB is not significant when fitness and social behaviours are controlled. One possible reason is that public facilities that serve residents' daily lives are scarce in places with higher industrial modernization, which is not conducive to residents' favourable evaluation of life. In addition, industrial modernization is significantly and positively related to both fitness and social behaviours, implying that the higher the office industry percentage and road connectivity are, the higher the treatment effect. This may be explained by the location characteristics of the office industry . The places where the office industry cluster are normally characterised by higher economic vitality and office services are abundant, e.g., cafés, malls, bars and upscale restaurants, which contribute to frequent social activity. Furthermore, high road connectivity potentially encourages a healthy behaviour-walking .\n\nThe influences of facility accessibility on SWB and behaviours are examined in the third quasi-experiment. The  indicate the significant association between facility accessibility and residents' behaviours and happiness. Since the straight-line distance is used to measure facility accessibility, the negative influences of facility accessibility on fitness and social behaviours denote that individuals who live in built environments that are accessible to public facilities tend to report regular physical exercise and social activities. This is consistent with previous research that proved the positive impact of public facilities on various dimensions of quality of life. E.g., residences near parks are related to both better physical and mental health . Shopping malls and municipal parks are the most common places for meeting friends, therefore, people living near these places report a higher probability of social activity. It is surprising that high facility accessibility shows an inhibiting effect rather than a facilitating effect on happiness. Congestion and negative environmental impacts may explain this. Diverse facilities in large cities are often accompanied by high living costs, congestion, noise pollution and traffic jams, which may decrease happiness .\n\nIn the last quasi-experiment, we test how travel convenience is connected with behaviours and SWB. Only fitness behaviour is significantly associated with travel convenience when the nearest neighbour matching method is used, which prevents us from\nmaking strong inferences regarding the relationship between travel convenience and SWB. However, it can be speculated that, compared with land use density, industrial modernization and facility accessibility, the travel convenience of the built environment plays a relatively insignificant role in residents' behaviour and SWB.",
        "15": "   \n\nThis paper adds to previous research by building a theoretical framework that simulates the effect of the built environment on SWB during the suburbanization process in metropolises of China, and estimates this effect using PSM. There are three main findings. Firstly, there was negligible difference in SWB between then old city zone, new city zone and exurban development zone in Hangzhou. However, differences in fitness and social behaviours were evident between the three districts. Secondly, both fitness and social behaviours are significantly and positively related to SWB, and fitness behaviour has a comparatively greater influence. Thirdly, after self-selection is controlled using PSM, all four dimensions of the built environment; land use density, industrial modernization, facility accessibility and travel convenience, are associated with the frequency of fitness behaviour. Industrial modernization and facility accessibility are associated with the frequency of social behaviour. Land use density and facility accessibility are associated with SWB.\n\nThis paper finds that the residents living in the new city zone report the highest SWB, and level of activity, whilst the residents of the exurban development zone are the least satisfied. This  has policy implications for the construction of the built environment in metropolises in China. The built environment in the exurban development zone has many problems. A similar  has also been found in other cities of China . In the government-led suburbanization process, the development of exurban development zones always places industrial development as the top priority. Consequently, their function as living areas is often neglected. In the process of suburbanization, a large number of industrial workers move in the exurban development zone. However, this case study of Hangzhou shows that even though there was complete suburbanization in the exurban development zone, the quality of the built environment was unsatisfactory. The government needs to develop effective policies to improve the built environment of exurban development zones.\n\nThe  of this paper indicate that land use density and facility accessibility have more significant impacts on SWB than industrial modernization and travel convenience. Consequently, the local government of Hangzhou should improve the land use mix and the equalization of public facilities in order to improve residents' life satisfaction. This suggestion also applies to other cities in China. For many decades, land-based urbanization has led to a land development mode of large-scale and single functions in urban China. Obviously, this urbanization model has been unable to meet the needs of high-quality development proposed by the central government. In future, the redevelopment and renewal of urban land should enrich the functions and types of land use. In addition, accessibility is premise for a comfortable and convenient life. Local governments should consider spatial equalization of public facilities, especially in exurban development zones. For example, diversified public services, especially more high-end public facilities, should be supplied to make residents' daily lives more convenient. In addition, it is important to improve the internal and external transportation networks of exurban development zones.\nAdditionally, although the differences in SWB among the three districts studied are slight, scholars, urban planners and the local government should pay sufficient attention to its potential expanding trend. In preparation for the  Asian Games in , Hangzhou has been upgrading the built environment of new city zones, such as by building stadiums, public transport facilities and parks. In contrast, the speed of urban renewal in the old city zone and exurban development zone is slower. In particular, the exurban development zone has a chronic lack of large public facilities. It can be expected that residents' life satisfaction between the three districts will diverge. Other cities in China are experiencing similar spatial imbalances in built environments, and local governments should be alert to this potential trend and take measures to avoid such imbalance of residents' life satisfaction and social contradictions that may be caused by the widening of the built environment gap.\n\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, only three districts of the case city are covered. Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate the  for the entire city, even though the three districts are the most representative areas in the suburbanization process. Wider research that covers all urban areas deserves exploration in the future. Secondly, the measurement of behaviour is incomplete. Only fitness and social behaviours are used in this paper, and only the frequencies of physical exercise and social activities are used as indicators. The survey in our research did not include information on different types of fitness and social behaviour. These factors can be explored in future when relevant data are available. Finally, the group heterogeneity of the influence of the built environment should be expanded in future research.\n\nFunding Funding provided by Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province, National Natural Science Foundation of China ."
