        "5": "  \n\nIn recent years, urbanization in developing countries has rapidly accelerated owing to the significant growth of the global economy. Urbanization has a positive impact on residents' quality of life by enhancing the quality of medical services and infrastructure available to them. However, the ongoing influx of people into urban environments means that it is estimated that by , most of the global population will reside in cities; indicating citizens may suffer more pressures resulting in some potential mental problems, with the increasing living costs and employment competition, as well as the less opportunities of visiting green spaces and accompanying families. According to the World Health Organization , more than , people die due to suicide worldwide, and mental health problems are one of the major contributors . Meanwhile, some research has also shown that approximately  million individuals worldwide experience\nmental illness, accounting for approximately  of the global population . On one hand, the continuous growing of mental problem  in a series of bad influences on medical system, including the rising loads of mental treatment services . On the other hand, it is reported that mental health issues result in a minimum annual cost of US  $ trillion to the global economy . The main goal of the  Agenda for Sustainable Development  is to \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages,\" including reducing one-third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment and promoting mental health and well-being . Thus, in light of the significant social and economic implications, it is crucial to thoroughly investigate the factors that affect the mental health of urban residents.\n\nPrevious research has extensively examined the impact mechanisms affecting mental health across various multidisciplinary fields, including sociology, psychology and geography. This has included investigating the driving factors, , and differences associated with mental health. First, studies on driving forces have mainly focused on environments   and perceptions  . Similarly, certain researchers have endeavored to investigate different  for measuring mental health and implementing new technologies . Furthermore, research interest has been drawn to the examination of mental health disparities, encompassing distinctions between urban and rural areas and sex-based disparities . Although existing research has drawn some important s regarding the impact mechanism of mental health, significant gaps remain. Prior research of mental health has mainly focused on specific groups, such as the elderly or the migrants, and has limited exploration of the feature of geographical spatial distribution. Thus, this study examines the spatial correlation and influencing mechanisms affecting residents' mental health in different regions of China, based on largescale population data obtained from the China Labor-force Dynamic Survey . A variety of influencing factors of objective environment and subjective perception were employed, including the built environment, work environment, and economic satisfaction, etc. Furthermore, the analysis also considered the comprehensive effects of random groups, as well as the varying effects on migrants and local residents. The findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for urban planners and decision makers, contributing to the enhancement of mental health among urban residents and helping to enable the further progress of cities in China.",
        "7": " . \n\nUrbanization has made cities becoming the ultimate destination for population agglomeration . As a result, the labor force characteristics of China's population are undergoing gradual changes. Urbanization and demographic transitions often lead\nto a range of health issues. Some studies have suggested that individuals in good health are typically the primary participants in this transition . Nevertheless, health risks do not manifest immediately but rather accumulate over time due to low adaptability or ongoing exposure to high-risk environments. Migrant workers often tend to find themselves in low-paying, dirty, harsh, and dangerous jobs compared to local permanent residents. This disparity can be attributed to differences in educational levels and household registration systems . In contrast to physical health issues, mental health concerns are often less apparent and more challenging to detect. Mental health disorders can generate various challenges and risks, including financial difficulties , lethargy , depression, and shorter lifespans . Thus, exploring the mechanisms that influence mental health has important practical implications. Sweetser first introduced the concept of mental health . This definition has since been further developed through ongoing research . As per the definition put forward by the World Health Organization in , mental health in this study is defined as a state of well-being in which an individual can realize their own potential, cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to the community.",
        "8": " . \n\nAs an  concept, most researchers generally choose to express mental health using multiple indicators. Consequently, psychological scale tools have emerged as the primary method for diagnosing mental health conditions. Internationally recognized scales that are frequently used include the Symptom Checklist- , the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule  and the Self-Rating Depression Scale , etc. On the above mental health scales, the reliability and validity of SCL- which is recognized as a classical scale have been tested in China , while SDS is difficult to evaluate depression with severe retardation symptoms, and the evaluation effect is poor for people with low educational level or slightly poor intellectual level . Meanwhile, PANAS has the limitations of an ordinal scale such as low precision and unsuitability for using with parametric statistics . In addition, with the development of data acquisition technology and hardware matching, the information collection mode of mental health has expanded to include wearable electronic devices with sensors  and other devices to monitor ecological instantaneous assessments, physiological functions, environmental parameters, physical behavior , ultimately forming a longitudinal dataset that allows for the real-time collection, but it needs a long cycle of time consumption. Finally, after comparing the features of the previous scales, Depression Self-Assessment Scale  is employed in this paper to measure mental health, because of its high quality of operability, reliability and recognition degree .",
        "9": " . \n\nThe determinants of mental health in previous researches have been mainly summarized into three aspects: built environment (e.g.,\nland development intensity, greening space rate, road network density), work environment , and subjective perception . The influence of these factors is usually related to the unequal distribution of social resources . Especially the living conditions of the public, including built environment by which residents are surrounded and the working environment where activities are carried out may make people prone to exert different psychological feelings, thereby affecting people's mental health . Therefore, it is important to study the influencing mechanism of built environment, work environment and subjective perception on mental health.\n\nOn the one hand, the built environment, as an activity platform for residents' daily lives, not only directly affects physical activity and active transportation , but is also indirectly related to the potential mental health risks caused by unreasonable housing and infrastructure. This has been confirmed in several studies . At the same time, green space can provide important health and environmental services, reduce economic and social inequalities, reduce the mental stress of urban residents, and provide people with better well-being and mental health . On the other hand, the impact of the work environment has also gradually come to receive greater attention with regard to its impact on mental health. Poor working conditions  can generate stress, fatigue and other negative emotions ; while long-term exposure to dangerous workplaces  can lead to increased health risks . Long working or commuting hours also reduce the time available for exercise, relaxation, and communication with family and friends, and increase feelings of isolation . Therefore, the improvement of environmental factors is crucial not only to promoting healthy physical activity and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, but also to providing people with the opportunity for psychological recovery and spiritual release, thus promoting better mental health and improving overall happiness .\n\nFurthermore, subjective perceptions are also important to mental health. It is believed that subjective environmental perceptions affect people's emotions and behavioral choices . If an environment can promote positive perceptions, people will be more inclined to continue engaging in activities in that environment . Previous research has shown a correlation between subjective environmental perception and healthy activities  . However, it is worth noting that subjective environmental perception is usually based on the objective environmental conditions, which guide individuals to produce corresponding behaviors . Thus, subjective environmental perception may act as a mediator between the environment and behavior, a fact that has been further verified across a number of different theoretical frameworks . From previous studies, it can be seen that the influencing factors of mental health mostly lie in the relationship between environment and mental health or subjective perception and mental health, and rarely have the relationship between various aspects and mental health at the same time. Therefore, this paper starts from the three aspects of built environment, work environment and subjective perception, and discusses the relationship between these variables and mental health. I hope it can provide some help for future research.",
        "11": " . \n\nThis study uses data from the  CLDS  conducted by the Centre for Social Science Investigation at Sun Yat-sen University. The CLDS project was the first interdisciplinary large-scale tracking social survey on labor status in China, focusing on the status quo and changes in China's labor force. The project covers education, work, migration, health, social participation, economic activities, grassroots organizations, and other research topics. The project sample population covers  provinces and cities in China , and the survey object is the entire labor force  within the sample households. This study used survey data from the CLDS in the  specifically as the total sample. The investigation included individual self-assessments of mental health, lifestyle, work environment, and economic status. Based on the needs of the study, the study initially excluded samples with missing or invalid self-rated mental health scale, number of Hukou transfer, and other key indicators. Among the remaining samples, there were  missing values for the variable \"fun to work\"  and  missing values for the variable \"part-time job\" . Subsequently, multiple imputation was employed to address the missing values, resulting in a complete database with a sample size of , . The sample size distributions in different regions are shown in Figure .\n\n\nFIGURE \nStudy areas.",

Built environment factors mainly include greening space\nrate, the number of hospitals, land development intensity, road network density and particulate matter .  index. Land development intensity refers to the proportion of total construction land in the administrative area. The work environment includes the variables of commuting time, employment hours , and employment status. Commuting time is expressed as the time it takes for a respondent to commute daily during their current or most recent job, while employment status is defined as either employed or unemployed. In addition, we divided participants' subjective perceptions into work feelings, community trust, economic satisfaction, and community security. Work feelings refers to a  items scale related to work. The scale uses a five-point scoring system  Community trust refers to a  items scale related to the trust to other different people.

        "16": " .  \n\nConsidering the possibility that mental health is affected by spatial differences in the environment and subjective perceptions . In this study, a single-level linear regression model was used to measure the impact mechanism on mental health. This study selected mental health as the dependent variable, used the Ordinary Least Squares   method to establish a linear regression model, and measured the impact of the built environment, work environment, and subjective perception of mental health.

        "18": " . \n\nThe average mental health scores are shown in Figure . Overall, the average mental health scores gradually increased from the western to the central and eastern regions. The average mental health scores of Jinzhou, Yingkou, Tongling and Taizhou were relatively high, indicating that the residents of these areas have better mental health status, they are happier, more optimistic and more resilient. While respondents from Beihai, Jinchang and Yangquan had relatively low mental health score, they may face more stress and psychological barriers in their daily lives.\n\nTo explore the spatial differentiation and autocorrelation characteristics of mental health in city scale, Global Moran's I  and Local Moran's I  were implemented. The Moran 's I index was . with a -score of . and a value of  , indicating that the mental health in study area has a positive correlation. As shown in Figure , we further explored the spatial differentiation characteristics of mental health using Local Indicators of Spatial Association  clustering at the city scale in the study area. The  of the LISA clustering significance test showed that, first, eastern regions, for example, cities in Shandong province, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Nantong in Yangtze River Delta and Dalian, Yingkou in Liaodong Peninsula generally showed a positive local spatial correlation with mental health and belonged to high-high clustering areas. This indicates that the mental health scores of the residents in and surrounding cities were higher overall, and they may generally have a better mental health status. Second, cities such as Shanghai, Chengde, Zhengjiang and Huai'an are low-high clustering areas, indicating that people living in those areas may have worse mental health status than surrounding cities. The high-low clustering areas including Shuozhou and Qinzhou, indicating that the mental health scores in these areas were higher than those in the surrounding areas. Low-low aggregation areas mainly included in cities in Gansu and Qinghai provinces such as Wuwei, Zhangye and Xining, indicating that the residents in these areas have relatively poor mental health.",
        "19": " .  \n\nAs shown in Table , regression analysis of the baseline model shows that there is a significant positive correlation in subjective perception factors, among which the coefficients of work feelings, community trust, economic satisfaction and community security are , and . , respectively. This means that better subjective feelings contribute to better mental health status, because better work experiences, friendly interpersonal relationships, higher income and higher sense of security mean lower levels of work stress and greater enthusiasm for life, a finding which is consistent with those recorded in previous studies . Second, in terms of the built environment, an increase in the greening space rate causes an increase of . point of mental health. Generally, a higher green space rate means higher environmental quality and more parks and other leisure\nplaces to promote social activities among residents, especially the elderly . An increase of Road network density also causes an increase of . point of mental health. A higher road network density may reduce vehicle\n\nFIGURE \nSpatial distribution of average mental health levels.\n\nThe People's Republic of China\n\nFIGURE \nSpatial autocorrelation of the mental health.\n\n\nspeed in the community, decreasing peoples' concerns regarding traffic accidents. Higher road network density can also improve accessibility to the community, providing more walking options to make it easier to reach service facilities . In addition, in terms of the work environment, commuting time had a significant negative correlation  with mental health. For control variables, age, marital status and low education have significant negative correlations with mental health with coefficients of . , -. , and -. , respectively. This result indicates that mental health may decline when people get aged, get married or have a low education level.\n\nThe mean of the mental health scores for local residents and migrants are . and . , respectively. The -test  for the differences between local residents and migrants' groups are statistically significant, as the significance  of Hukou transfer is higher than . for Levene's test and less than . in the -test . The mental health of local residents' group  seems higher than those of migrants group . Thus, the following section further delves into the impact mechanism of mental health and explores the impact of the built environment, work environment and subjective perception on mental health between migrants and local residents.",
        "20": " . \n\nAs shown in Table , by constructing a subsample model for migrants and local residents groups, we found that work feeling , community trust  and economic satisfaction were all significantly and positively correlated with mental health. However, there are some differences in the factors that affect the mental health of migrants and local residents. For the migrants group, the coefficient of economic satisfaction  is higher than the local residents group . The reason for this phenomenon may be that migrants usually desire a higher level of income to settle down, so they face more pressure, creating a significant psychological burden , especially\n\n\n\n\n:    , and  Represent significance levels of , , and , respectively.\n\n\n.\nfor female migrants . Better economic satisfaction may help migrants improve their mental health. Besides, among local residents, community security was found to be significantly related to mental health , while the migrants group shows no significance among community security. Furthermore, for the local residents group, the coefficient of community trust  is higher than migrants group . The scope of activities among local resident communities is relatively stable, meaning where they live is a very important consideration. The safety and trust of the community are important requirements for local residents who usually have children, and children are usually more susceptible to potential artificial hazards   or natural hazards  . For the built environment and work environment, both the migrants group and the local residents group show positive significance in the greening space rate and road network density to mental health. Previous studies found that community green spaces can alleviate the homesickness of the migrants by increasing social cohesion and have\na positive effect on the mental health, and local residents may pay attention to the greening of their living environment due to their long-term stable living characteristics . Commuting time has a negative impact on mental health. Commuting drains energy and attention. Long-time commutes to work are likely to be much more tiring and stressful than shorter time commutes . Excessively long commutes may reduce people's mental health and may increase the risk of depression . For other variables, the number of hospitals, land development intensity, PM. index, parttime or not and employment status show no significance.",
        "21": "   \n\nUsing the  CLDS database, this study explored the impact mechanisms between the built and work environment, subjective perception, and mental health by constructing a regression model and exploring the differences between migrants and local residents\nwhile exploring the spatial correlates of mental health. The findings of this study are as follows. On the one hand, the increase of greening space rate, road network density, rework feelings, community trust, and economic satisfaction will benefit the mental health of both migrants and residents, while the increase of commuting time will be harmful to mental health. On the other hand, there are also some differences in the impact of different factors on the subsamples of migrants and local residents, respectively. Firstly, the greening space rate and community trust have a significant impact on residents' mental health, especially for local residents. Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that community security is found to be significantly correlated with the mental health of local residents, and shows no significance in migrants. In addition, individuals' mental health showed obvious spatial differences, with the areas with larger differences mainly located in central-eastern China.\n\nBased on these , the following measures are recommended to improve mental health status in China: First, individuals' work experience and economic income must be improved. One means of achieving this is by gradually increasing the proportion of labor remuneration in primary distribution through national policy support, mobilizing the enthusiasm of workers across the whole of Chinese society, and further promoting workers' level of income in the process . However, enterprises also need to create a good work environment for employees, regularly conduct mental health examination activities, provide reasonable social security, and promote the mental health of workers. Second, infrastructure must be improved and the volume of community exchanges must be increased. Urban planning managers should conduct reasonable community planning and enrich public service facilities to provide residents with more space for interaction and to enhance their sense of security in the community . Furthermore, green areas in urban public spaces should be increased to improve urban construction and management, especially the public health environment. Governments at all levels should pay more attention to healthy cities and increase support for health services, while increasing investment in community health service institutions, standardizing the management of public health institutions, and optimizing the construction of mental health workforces. In addition, community staff also need to strengthen the publicity of health service policies, popularize healthy lifestyles to the public, improve residents' mental health awareness, and at the same time to meet the residents' mental health needs, mobilize their motivation and participate in the community health service work. This improves the natural environment, social environment and health services in cities, creating better and healthier cities .\n\nThis study has a number of limitations. First, the data used were cross-sectional data from the year , and the exploration of time evolution was limited. In future, spatiotemporal differences could be explored using CLDS data from different years. Second, this study used regression to explore the impact mechanisms affecting mental health status among Chinese residents; in the future, attempts can be made to assess these same variables from multiple perspectives using a variety of different models, such as the mediation model. Moreover, based on the data obtained, this study divides the independent variables into three dimensions: work environment, built environment, and subjective perception.\n\nThus, the possibility of a different impact mechanism that affects mental health status can be explored through a more enriched dataset."
