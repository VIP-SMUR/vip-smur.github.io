        "2": " \n\n: There is increasing focus on designing workspaces that promote less sitting, more movement and interaction to improve physical and mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates a natural intervention of a new workplace with active design features and its relocation to a greener and open space. : An ecological model was used to understand how organisations implement change. Pre and post survey data from  matched cases of workers and accelerometery data  were analysed. :  show a decrease in occupational sitting  and an increase in workplace walking  using survey data, and accelerometery data . Improvements in interaction, musculoskeletal pain and mental health were reported. S: Application of the ecological model shows that the organisation understands how to target the built environment and social/cultural environment but not how to target behaviour change at the individual level.\n\n\n Building design, workplace, physical activity, social interactions, ecological model",
        "3": " . \n\nActive workplace designs encourage physical activity  and greater social connectedness through adaptations to the built environment, workplace policies and culture . These designs are impactful as they have the capacity to target and reach everyone in a workplace as\n\nopposed to specific workplace initiatives  and services  that frequently reach those who choose to opt-in . Office workers are a sedentary population, spending  of time at work sitting . In particular, over a third of their total sitting time at work is accrued in stretches of prolonged sitting  . This is problematic as high levels of occupational sitting are a modifiable risk factor for most non-communicable diseases and premature mortality , poor mental health  and musculoskeletal problems such as neck and shoulder pain ; as well as harmful for work outcomes such as lower productivity , poor work engagement , and sickness presenteeism .\n\nActive workplace design places greater emphasis on the organisation of workspace, unassigned and shared desks, space provision for supporting tasks and supporting technology that enables movement . Combined with more prominent staircases, more open workspaces, sit-stand desks and stand-up meeting desks, these designs encourage and allow workers to sit less and move more frequently during the day to find the best place to focus on their work tasks . It also allows for greater interaction and collaborative working . There are reported benefits of active workplace designs on physical health  as well as on important work outcomes such as increased social interaction, satisfaction and task performance . However, the effect on mental health is not clear  as other factors in the workplace environment such as poor or inconsistent heating, lighting, noise and air quality of the workplace environment can have a negative impact on health and wellbeing . High levels of spatial density and unassigned desks at work can produce a sense of crowding, lack of privacy and personal control , low levels of work satisfaction and task performance .\n\nThe external neighbourhood environment of a workplace and how one travels to work all potentially influence physical activity behaviours in and around the workplace . For example, nearby pleasant walkable environments may reduce physical movement inside the workplace as workers choose to walk during their breaks or hold walking meetings and then sit and work in the remaining time. Distance from home, density, connectivity, and land use diversity  will impact on how people travel to work, and both active  and passive commutes  may affect how much workers move around work . Equally, high workload, tight work deadlines and the need for visibility by managers, or access to supportive technology may also affect how much workers are able to move around the building and accrue the health and social benefits of physical activity.",
        "4": " .. \n\nThere is a significant gap in our understanding of how business organisations understand and implement active workplace design on their own. This can\nperhaps be best understood through the ecological framework . This theory-based framework suggests health behaviour, and more specifically here, physical activity, is influenced by four nested hierarchical levels: Individual determinants, social/cultural environment, built environment and the policy environment. At the individual level, characteristics such as, gender, age, racial/ethnic identity, knowledge and attitudes influence behaviour change. However, health behaviour is less impacted by individual knowledge and attitudes  and more influenced by the environments in which individuals live, play, learn or work in. The social/cultural environment includes the influence from social networks, social support systems from co-workers, managers and relevant others and the social norms and culture that operate within that environment. The built environment refers to not only to the building design, its stairways, workspace, office layout , and workstations, but also to the nearby urban design, transport and green spaces. At the policy level, structural factors, rules and regulations also affect health behaviours. This includes workplace policies and processes, and job design and resources . All of these factors will influence not only the individual, their behaviours and their health, but also in how active workplace designs are implemented in the first place. Using the model in this context advances our knowledge and understanding of all the factors that impact health behaviours including the social determinants of health for active workplace designs. Most often, studies do not provide a complete perspective or how organisations attempt to implement behaviour change. We use this model to advance our understanding of how change is implemented by organisations who have no knowledge or training in using theory or effective behaviour change  to achieve the change they desire in their workforce .\n\nIn the current study, we evaluated the impact a natural intervention on the impact of a new workplace built using active workplace design features to improve the health and wellbeing of workers by encouraging less sitting, more movement and more interaction through flexible working and use of nearby open spaces and facilities. We use the socio-ecological framework to capture the 'active ingredients' of the workplace design and its surrounding environment. We hypothesised that compared to the 'old' building design and ways of working, the new building and its active workplace design will increase physical activity and social interaction\n\namong workers as well as higher satisfaction with the building design and outdoor spaces. We further hypothesised that the active workplace design will increase positive health and wellbeing outcomes. Finally, we hypothesised that the active workplace design will also improve organisational health outcomes such as sickness absence, engagement, job satisfaction and performance.",

The buildings had physical Local Area Network  for internet capabilities and no WIFI. This meant workers were limited in moving around and using open workspaces. This also resulted in minimal hot desking behaviour despite a policy promoting hot desking, with staff usually working in the same area with the same people.\n\nThe new building is located just outside the inner city in a district that has businesses and residential neighbourhoods with good infrastructure.

        "17": " .\n\nThis study focused on the impact of a new workplace built using active workplace design features on workers' sedentary behaviour, workplace interactions and physical and mental health. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to evaluate a relocation to a building with not only active design features but also how the organisation implemented change though its use of a new Ways of Working directive to encourage both movement and interaction within the building and to encourage the use of the outside open spaces and facilities.\n\nApplying the ecological model to our , our study found beneficial impacts on reduced sitting and increased walking at work post move thus supporting hypotheses  . These self-report findings are supported by the accelerometery data with an average of  minutes reduction in workplace sitting time per day, and an increase in standing time by  minutes and stepping time by  minutes per day post move. These findings are notable, and support Engelen et al.  self-report findings and the objectively measured findings of Gorman et al.  and Jancey et al  but not those of Foley et al.\nDescriptive statistics and linear mixed model regression: survey findings pre-post move \n\n\n is considered significant.  case of missing data  treated with multiple imputation.  is considered significant.\n\nChanges in pre and post-move objectively measured occupational sitting and physical activity and blood pressure \n\n\n is considered significant.\n, Elyer et al.  and Hallman et al.  who found no reduction in sitting time as measured by the activPAL. However, the differences between these latter three studies and our study is the lack of a control group in our study, which may account for the different . Further differences could be accounted for by the built environment itself and the new Ways of Working directive . For example, the increase in the number of break out spaces, the  of sit-stand desks for all staff and the new hybrid laptops allowing workers to not be chained to a desk. Coupled with the social/cultural environment, whereby the new Ways of Working directive encourages workers to move around by actively asking managers to support their teams using the different building spaces  and in agile working. Both of these latter points were found to have significantly increased post move, thus reflecting increase in the behavioural autonomy of workers to move around more and use the spaces available to them. A study by Sugiyama et al.  based on an RCT of a sit-stand desk intervention, found participants who perceived sufficient informal space and reported more-supportive organizational norms had lower levels of sitting time. As Sugiyama's study was based on an sit-stand desk intervention and perceptions of existing space and support, our study provides evidence for the impact of not just the  of sit-stand desks, but also the impact of increased spaces and changes in organisational policies and social/cultural norms for sitting less, standing and moving more.\n\nThe built environment, social/cultural environment and policy level changes may have also resulted in an increase in interactions between team members and colleagues including unplanned social interactions and align with previous findings  supporting our hypotheses  . Our findings contribute to the emerging evidence that buildings with active design features have positive effects on communication and interactions .\n\nContrary to our hypotheses  , we found no significant difference in self-reported stair use or in physical activity. The reduction in stair use could be explained by the increase in the number of lifts available in the new building and the larger floorplates both potentially reducing movement between floors. However, it could also be accounted for by the lack of motivational and educational messages to use the stairs which the previous building had displayed in their stairwells. Future studies should include direct\nobservations of stair use and infrared motion tracking  of stairwell use .\n\nConfirming hypothesis , our study found participants rated their mental health higher and reported reductions in some types of musculoskeletal complaints post-move.  from blood pressure measurements also support hypothesis  . Reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of  can significantly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, subsequently small reductions of this magnitude are considered clinically meaningful . Overall, these  suggest that the active design features of the building, the new location and the new Ways of Working directive may have a positive effect on health. Our findings are novel as other similar natural intervention studies have found little impact. Engelen et al.  reported a reduction in lower back pain only, and no difference for mental health. Bergstrom  found no effects at all in their longitudinal study.\n\nOne of the most consistent findings from user surveys is that office workers are dissatisfied with the 'open plan' office, whether this is due to noise levels, distractions, and/or lack of privacy . In our study, open plan offices were retained rather than introduced may explain the positive rather than negative  on physical and mental health. Furthermore, in the present study, participants were highly satisfied with the overall open workspaces provided in the new building as well as the access to outdoor spaces and together with reducing sitting and increased walking these factors may have all influenced workers physical and mental health. Evidence from sit-stand intervention studies provide some support for this suggestion . Few have measured physical and mental health in their studies and a recent review found the evidence to be unclear . Our study contributes to this area of research and shows that the built environment, social/cultural environment and the organisational policies around sitting less and interacting more, can together have a positive impact on health and wellbeing.\n\nConfirming our third hypothesis, workers had increased work-related vigor  post-move. Increased work-related vigor or vitality has been reported in other studies , and as it is considered to be an active, positive state, it may be associated with the decrease in sitting and increases in standing and stepping, as workers are breaking up their sitting time and moving around . Contrary to the hypotheses, perceived\njob performance decreased and there were no significant findings in job satisfaction, work absorption and dedication, job control, job demands, work-related support and self-reported or objectively measured sickness absence post move. Other studies have also found a decrease in job performance following a move to a building with active design features . It could be that post move assessments at two months is not long for adapting to change  and longer assessment periods are needed. Likewise, this may also be the case for job satisfaction and for sickness absence, and for the latter, the recording period  may be too short to see any meaningful effects.",
        "18": " .. \n\nOur assessment of the way the agency implemented change suggests that they understood and targeted four levels of the socio-ecological model: policy/organisational level, built environment, social/ cultural environment through their re-location and the  of the new Ways of Working directive . Whilst the agency did consult with their workers and set up representatives  from each team, the individual level of the model was not targeted in any training or educational or persuasive messages in the benefits of more movement and interaction. Furthermore, no evidence-based behaviour change techniques were encouraged among workers such as action planning, goal setting and self-monitoring standing and moving more . Our  suggest that whilst changes were observed in sitting less, standing and moving more and an increase in some types of interaction, it is possible more differences may have been observed if the agency had included targeting change at the individual level . Nevertheless, the study shows how targeting policy/organisational level, built environment and social/cultural environment without targeting the individual level can produce behaviour change and contributes the evidence from workplace communities to that of other research  that has found the individual level less important in producing behaviour change. Further research is required to examine whether these changes are sustainable without targeting at the individual level. More research is also required to investigate the knowledge and attitudes organisations have about implementing behaviour change strategies at the individual level when relocating.",
        "19": " .. \n\nThe present study has several strengths. While addressing a natural intervention, our study employed a prospective pre and post measures design with the same sample of office workers within a single organization. Another strength of the study was the multiple methodologies used to collect data. Objectively measured sitting, standing and stepping time through accelerometers strengthened our self-reported findings. A further strength is the use of the ecological model to guide our data collection. However, in our study, no individual level strategies  were introduced by the organisation to support the workers' move and engagement with the new Ways of Working directive. This may have further strengthened our use of the model. However, a review on workplace approaches to reduce sitting reported that interventions focusing on individuallevel strategies often show small effects, whereas those that include environmental interventions typically generate greater reductions in sitting time . Other limitations include the low response rate to our survey at both times and of which only  participants could be linked with their pre and post survey responses. With regard to our health assessment and accelerometery data, there may have been a selfselection bias and those who agreed to participate may have been different from the group who did not volunteer to participate. Our findings should therefore be interpreted with caution.",
        "20": " . \n\nThe  of the present study demonstrate that relocating to a new workplace built with active workplace design features can have some health promoting effects, a positive impact on some types of interactions and change worker perceptions of the workplace. Future studies should examine how the different levels of the socio-ecological model interact to impact on employee health and wellbeing, and job related outcomes in an organisational change toward an active workplace design. Further longer-term research is needed that explores and examines the assumed underlying mechanisms of change and their effect on well-being, attitudinal and performance-related outcomes at each level."
