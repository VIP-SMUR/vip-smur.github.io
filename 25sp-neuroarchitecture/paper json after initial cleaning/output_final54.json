        "6": " \n\nPrevious research has shown that apartment housing quality is a crucial determinant of mental health. While the construction of high-rise buildings is a popular policy strategy for accommodating population growth in cities, there is still much debate about the health consequences of living in highrise apartments. Australian cities are experiencing a significant boom in apartment construction that will leave a legacy for future generations. A significant critique of the current evidence base is a lack of policy and design specificity; housing studies have not evaluated design outcomes or health impacts of the policies or legislation that underpin the design and delivery of buildings. In addition, studies typically do not include detailed assessments of apartment design or adherence to policy and design standards. There is also an emerging shift in focus from housing characteristics that prevent discomfort, dissatisfaction, or disease, to how design can create conditions that foster positive outcomes and enhance occupants' social and emotional wellbeing.",
        "7": " \n\nThis study makes a crucial contribution to the literature. It is the first study to measure and examine the implementation and composition of design requirements  derived from operational apartment design policies and their association with residents' positive mental health in a large sample of buildings and residents across three cities. It provides empirical evidence of a dose-response relationship\ninsufficient space, restrictive layouts, low levels of sunlight and natural ventilation, and inability to control environmental stressors  can adversely impact residents' quality of life, influence mental health through increasing anxiety and stress  and have been associated with depressive symptoms and mental health issues.  Higher density living may also impact mental health through social mechanisms  with studies reporting that high-rise occupants experience increased loneliness or social isolation, negatively influencing mental wellbeing.  A systematic review explored the collective evidence on the longitudinal impact of housing disadvantage in  temporally ordered studies where the exposure to housing disadvantage preceded mental health measures. Substandard housing quality was shown to be linked to higher stress levels, anxiety was higher in renters than owners and overcrowding was linked to a measure of mean depressive symptoms but not a depressive disorder.  Another longitudinal study also reported a decrease in depressive symptoms and that improvements to the dwelling were related to improved mental health. \nbetween implementing a combination of  apartment policy design requirements and positive mental wellbeing.

        "3": "Substandard housing is a significant public health issue. There is a well-developed international evidence base linking inadequate indoor air quality, space, natural ventilation, sunlight, acoustic and visual privacy, insulation, and thermal comfort with various physical health impacts, including asthma, hypertension, upper respiratory tract infections, poor sleep quality, and infectious and chronic diseases. Moreover, the effects of prolonged exposure to poor quality housing and associated physical ill health can, in turn, have negative implications for the psychological health of residents. A number of cross-sectional studies from highincome countries with a focus on mental health outcomes have found that apartment residents have poorer mental health than residents in other housing typologies, and emerging evidence indicates that apartment design may play a role in this association.",
        "8": " \n\nOur  have practical implications as they identify the combination of design requirements that should be prioritised in building design and approval processes to promote optimal resident mental health outcomes. The findings reiterate the importance of architecture and design instruments that facilitate the implementation of minimum policy standards to guide architectural and urban design thinking, policy, and practice and, ultimately, the health of future high-rise housing stock. Moreover, these findings provide vital empirical evidence to inform national and international apartment and high-rise housing policy and design instruments and practices to protect the health of people living in apartments. The  can be used to advocate for the adoption  or retention  of the specific design features identified in future design policies. Finally, this study addresses a significant gap in the literature, providing empirical evidence that apartment buildings that adhere to Australian apartment design policies have the potential to promote the positive mental wellbeing of the inhabitants.\n\nHowever, definite s cannot currently be drawn with the conflicting evidence due to differences in methodological approaches and substantial heterogeneity in how both the mental health outcome variable and housing quality was defined and measured. \n\nInternationally and within Australia, there is growing emphasis on compact city planning policies to help realise urban sustainability goals. As such, apartments are housing a rapidly increasing number of people. Nearly one-third  of the almost one million new dwellings across Australia from  to  were apartments.  This apartment boom has raised concerns about the potential negative impacts of poor design on apartment building residents, however few studies have examined apartment design and health in Australia.  Most studies have been conducted in North America and Europe, where the public sector developed many high-rise residential buildings after the Second World War in deprived areas.  This may partly account for the adverse mental health outcomes of apartment housing.  Additionally, previous studies have compared living in high-rise buildings to other housing types, but have not considered differences in design quality or\ncharacteristics of varying high-rise buildings and apartments.\n\nStudies exploring high-rise living or apartment design and mental health have typically relied on measures of negative mental health, such as psychological distress, that are indicative of impaired mental health and may reflect common mental disorders, like depressive and anxiety disorders,  but at a level insufficient for the diagnosis of a disorder or psychiatric illness.  However, there is increasing international interest in positive mental health that refers to the presence of positive emotions and good functioning, defined by The World Health Organisation as \"a state of wellbeing which allows individuals to realise their abilities, cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively and fruitfully, and make a contribution to their community\",  p.).\n\nA significant critique of the current evidence base is a lack of policy and design specificity. Studies have rarely evaluated the design outcomes of the policies or legislation that underpin the design of the buildings studied and have not included detailed or direct assessments of apartment design or adherence to these policy and design standards.  Barros et al.,   have called for a re-examination of housing policies from a multidisciplinary perspective that considers public health concerns together with more empirical research to guide evidence-informed design decisions. Moreover, there is an emerging shift in focus from housing characteristics that prevent discomfort or disease, to how design can create conditions conducive to positive outcomes that enhance occupants' physical, social and emotional wellbeing  and an analysis of how apartment design can contribute to positive mental health.

        "9": " \n\nThe boom in apartment construction in Australia has prompted the  of residential apartment design policies by state governments to regulate and improve design outcomes conducive to good amenity and wellbeing.  For example, in , the NSW state government introduced the State Environmental Planning Policy   and Apartment Design Guide.  Other Australian states have since followed suit: the Western Australian government introduced State Planning Policy .  Residential Design Codes Volume  - Apartments in ; and the Victorian state government introduced the Better Apartments Design Standards  in .  All three policies acknowledge apartment design's role in promoting health and wellbeing and include explicit aims to achieve this. Our previous analysis evaluated how well contemporary apartment buildings conformed with the respective state policies and identified the importance of a comprehensive design policy to achieving better apartment design and amenity.  However, empirical research evaluating whether the implementation of these apartment design policies is associated with\nresidents' health is rare  and there is little understanding of which combination of apartment policy design requirements are optimal for promoting positive mental health outcomes for residents. Previous studies have used cluster analysis techniques to reveal neighbourhood 'types' with different combinations of built environment characteristics important for supporting physical activity behaviours.  In our study context, this technique can be applied to characterise apartment building types and explore how different combinations of apartment design features impact residents' mental health and wellbeing.\n\nThis paper aimed to assess the performance and impact of apartment design policies in three Australian states by  characterising the apartment buildings based on the 'mix' or combination of policy design requirements implemented; and  exploring the combination of design requirements associated with the positive mental health of apartment residents.",

These design elements were derived from prior research that audited apartment design policies for their potential to promote health  and were broadly consistent with the groupings of design requirements in the three policies. Design requirements that impacted the ease and experience of apartment living were also extracted:  bicycle and car parking; and  apartment mix. Design requirements were eligible if they included a stated and potentially measurable criterion or standard relating to the design of the apartment, residential floors, or building. \n\nTo assess the implementation of each design requirement in the apartment buildings, tailored measures were created using architectural or development plans  sourced from development applications for the apartment buildings.  Where buildings were sited within the same apartment complex, the communal space measures for the complex were assigned to all buildings in that complex. Architecturally qualified research assistants extracted data for each requirement. The measures were developed with guidance from a stakeholder panel comprised of professional architects and urban designers from the Department of Planning Lands and Heritage and the Western Australian Office of the Government Architect. Data were extracted and measures computed for , residential apartments and  residential floors within the  buildings.

        "13": " Identifying cluster-derived building types and combinations of design features\n\nCluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis technique for organising observed data into meaningful groups based on combinations of independent variables, which maximises the similarity of cases within each group while maximising the dissimilarity between initially unknown groups.  First, a Ward's hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to help determine the number of clusters. Hierarchical clustering typically starts with single objects which are combined to create clusters based on similarity. Clusters are then combined until one single cluster is achieved. The appropriate number of clusters is determined using the distance measure between cluster formations from the agglomeration schedule, where a large jump in the agglomeration\nschedule is indicative of the appropriate number of clusters. The K-means method is the most common of the 'partitioning' clustering analyses for splitting a dataset into a set of  groups.  A series of -means cluster analyses were run on all  measured design requirements for the  buildings to identify homogeneous clusters of buildings with differing combinations of design requirements. All variables were standardised  so that each design requirement is reflected in the cluster analysis on the same scale. Different cluster solutions were obtained, and the within-cluster variance was used to decide on the optimal number of clusters .\n\nOnce the clusters were determined , T-tests were run on the  design requirements  to determine statistically significant differences between apartment and building measures by cluster to assess how statistically distinct the clusters were from one another and identify which classifying variables were significantly different between the cluster groupings .",

        "18": "\n\nUnprecedented global population growth has highlighted the need to consider how cities are built, and people are housed. As a result, Australian cities are experiencing a pronounced increase in apartment construction. The evidence to date suggests that housing design can affect the mental health of building occupants. Still, few studies have explored how to optimise the design of high-density housing to promote residents' mental wellbeing.  Consequently, there is a need for empirical evaluation of the design policies recently introduced in Australia to assess the performance of the\ndelivered buildings. This can guide evidence-informed architectural and design policy and advance future practices for good apartment design and high-rise living.\n\nThis is the first study to examine:  the implementation and composition of design requirements derived from apartment design policies; and  their association with residents' positive mental health based on a substantial sample of residents and buildings across multiple cities. The  revealed a strong dose-response relationship between policy implementation and mental wellbeing. Residents living in\n\nTable : Characteristics of the High Life participant sample.\n\n\n:    P comparing differences from Pearson Chi-Square  and independent samples t-test . Bold denotes significant at . *Mean and standard deviation  for continuous variables.\n'high policy performance buildings', with greater implementation of a combination of design requirements  for solar and daylight access, acoustic and visual privacy, private open space, storage, communal circulation spaces, car parking and greater mixes of apartments, had significantly higher positive mental wellbeing.\n\nThe key design requirements identified in this study are supported by previous studies on housing design and health. The benefits of natural light are well documented, from vitamin D production  to enhancing sleep patterns, mood, focus and productivity.  Inadequate daylighting or poor window views have been found to increase the probability of depression by  and , respectively.  Our findings also align with studies on indoor environments and the importance of natural ventilation and thermal comfort on occupants' physical health and cognitive function.  While noise is pervasive in urban environments,  noise from neighbours is perceived as more annoying by apartment residents and has been linked to a range of non-auditory health effects and adverse health outcomes,  including sleep disturbance, cardiovascular disease and impairment of cognitive performance in children.  Perceptions of apartment space and layout, and communal area quality have also been independently associated with mental wellbeing.  Internal private space typically impacts wellbeing via crowding, but quality communal areas may help minimise crowding by providing exposure to green space and the opportunity to interact with neighbours.  An analysis of the communal outdoor space in the High Life buildings found the use of outdoor areas was positively associated with neighbouring, which protects against loneliness,  and in turn, poor mental health.  Importantly, our study approached apartment design holistically, testing a wide range of requirements across multiple design elements to identify the combination of requirements that are associated with mental health, rather than a siloed focus on specific design elements.\n\nOur study derived measures from three operational apartment design policies, but notably these policies provided different levels of design guidance, as evidenced by the different number of design requirements represented from each state policy . For example, of the  design requirements in Cluster \\ that were positively associated with increased positive mental health scores using the more stringent Bonferroni significance level,  are currently included in the Victorian government design policy . This suggests that in its current form, the policy may be unable to bring about positive mental health benefits. Conversely, the NSW  and WA  policies contained  and   of the identified optimal mix of design requirements, respectively. These  provide clear\n\n\nevidence to help policymakers advocate for the adoption or inclusion of specific requirements  or the retention of design requirements (where\npresently included) during future policy reviews and iterations. Indeed, several design requirements that were included in the original draft of the Victorian standards were relaxed or removed after public comment,  highlighting the importance of empirical evidence to support or defend key standards and policy decisions.\n\nThis study has several strengths that uniquely contribute to the evidence base. First, interdisciplinary collaborations that integrate social scientists, health researchers, urban designers and architects are scarce. However, they are vital to facilitate meaningful research exploring the relationship between apartment design and mental health and isolate design factors' effect on mental health.  This study directly addresses this gap through a unique multidisciplinary and rigorous approach that provides policymakers, architects, and urban designers with empirical evidence on apartment design policy implementation and its association with mental health in three Australian capital cities. Second, a novel aspect of the High Life project was measuring the on-ground delivery of the apartment design policies in the buildings . The development and use of policy-specific and architecturally grounded measures of design in apartment buildings is unique. Third, using cluster analysis to characterise the buildings based on the combination of the design features implemented is a novel approach to quantify the design performance of the apartment buildings.\n\nLastly, research  suggests that the WEMWBS could detect a clinically meaningful change.  A review of  prior studies tested whether WEMWBS was able to detect a change on mental wellbeing at a group level.  Across all studies the standardised response mean  was greater than .  which compares favourably to other mental illness and life satisfaction scales, generic health-related quality of life scales, and disease specific scales and indicates that WEMWBS is responsive to changes in mental health interventions in different populations  Our mean difference in cluster groups of  points  and a regression estimate of a . higher WEMWBS score in \"high policy performance buildings\" versus \"low policy performance buildings\" indicates a sufficiently large difference between the clusters to be of real and meaningful difference in mental wellbeing of the two clustered groups.\n\nThe three design policies evaluated are performancebased, thus developers are not required to meet all standards if they apply innovative solutions that satisfy the intent of the objectives.  Indeed, our previous analysis found that buildings in Sydney  had on average implemented just  of the measured NSW policy design requirements.  The  of this study identified the combinations of policy design requirements that\narchitects were adopting. Notably, the findings indicate that when this combination of selected design requirements is implemented to a sufficient level, the policy can be a viable intervention to promote the positive mental wellbeing of occupants.\n\nWhile this study focused on Australian apartment design policies, the  are directly applicable to other international policies that were similarly introduced to regulate the standard of high-rise buildings and apartment design in their respective jurisdictions.  These findings provide empirical evidence for the inclusion or retention of specific design features and architectural solutions in future iterations of the policies for promoting mental wellbeing.\n\nThis study makes a unique contribution to the evidence base. However, it has some limitations:  the cross-sectional design means causality cannot be inferred;  The design requirement standards are based mainly on industry 'best practice' and intuition rather than empirical evidence, and there has been little evaluation of whether these thresholds are appropriate. Testing the appropriateness of the  policy standards was outside the scope of this study but is an important area for future research;  Building measures were extracted from the architectural plans and elevations submitted in the development application process. Whilst it is possible that the final constructed buildings deviated from the approved development application materials, our measurement process screened the building plans against other data sources  and buildings that were noticeably different from the approved plans were excluded from the study ;  Our analysis controlled for numerous socio-demographic variables associated with mental health, however, we accept that mental health may be impacted by other, unmeasured confounders, including the location of the apartment building, levels of crime and violence in the neighbourhood and perceived neighbourhood disorder  and air pollution.   Human ethics approval for the study required the focus of the survey to be stated on all recruitment materials. As such participants may have been able to surmise the study hypothesis which may have subconsciously biased them to respond in a way they think is expected. ",
