        "5": " The impact of built environment on physical activity and subjective well-being of urban residents: A study of core cities in the Yangtze River Delta survey Objective: In cities with high population density in China, the impact of built environment on human health is rather complicated. Physical activities are an important factor in promoting people's health. This study is aimed to explore ways of enhancing the residents' intensity of physical activities and psychological health in a limited built environment. For this purpose, this study conducted research on  residents from cities in the Yangtze River Delta in China to clarify the complicated correlations among the residents' physical activities, the multidimensional geographic environment characteristics, and subjective well-being.\n: First, Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale , International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form , and Subjective Well-being Scale for Chinese Citizens  were used to measure built environment characteristics, intensity of physical activities, and subjective wellbeing. Second, the correlations among built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being were analyzed, which reflected different effects of built environment characteristics on physical activities and subjective well-being. Third, physical activities were viewed as a mediating variable in SEM to analyze the influence mechanism of each built environment characteristic on the subjective well-being of residents.\n\nResult: Residents with different individual characteristics may have different levels of perception and usage of built environment. The intensity of physical activities has significant positive correlations with proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, and public security, while no significant correlation with overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity. The residents' subjective well-being has significant positive correlations with accessibility of destinations, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security, while no significant correlation with proximity to supporting facilities and street connectivity. Physical activities not only have a direct effect on subjective well-being, but also a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and built environment characteristics.\n: In the future, more research could be conducted on the optimization of correlations between residential built environment characteristics and physical activities as well as subjective well-being, so\nas to gain a deeper understanding about the impact of residential built environment on people's physical and mental health.",

        "7": " \n\nAs urbanization expands globally, cities have markedly improved people's health with better medical services and mature infrastructure. However, the fast-speed expansion has also led to problems such as chronic diseases and mental illnesses. A large number of studies have shown that public health is closely related to built environmental factors such as urban land use, development density and transportation system . A good residential environment can not only promote healthy physical activity, reduce the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases, but also provide people with psychological recovery and mental release, thus promoting mental health and improving happiness . In , WHO initiated the Healthy Cities Campaign and identified the urban built environment as an important factor affecting public health. Thus, the built environment became an important entry point for human settlements planning to actively intervene in health .\n\nSocial ecological model, the theoretical basis of healthy city, believes that people's health status is subject not only to their genes and roles in social and economic lives, but also to the external built environment, social environment, and natural environment . As technologies such as GIS, RS, and GPS get mature, scholars of geographics start to consider built environment characteristics and believe that a positive and friendly urban environment encourages the residents' participation in physical activities and is conducive to human health .\n\nBuilt environment refers to the sum of physical characteristics that encompass the surroundings, or a spatial combination of various physical environmental characteristics such as land use, transportation system, and infrastructure . In early time, Cervero et al. proposed a D conceptual model of built environment, which comprises density, diversity, and urban design . On that basis, Ewing et al. added two more concepts, namely accessibility of destinations and distance to transit, forming a new \"  D \" model . In research on built environment and physical activities by Boarnet and others, environment characteristics such as population density, employment density, distance to transit, and distance to city center exhibit a significant impact on residents' physical activities . The higher the degree of mixed land use, the more convenient it is for people to travel. When the travel distance gets shorter, people are more likely to choose green travel and thus have more physical activities . Oakes et al.\nalso found that, a compact community of high density could encourage the residents to travel more on foot or by bike, which also means more physical activities . Besides, the distance from the residential area to the entertainment area, well-equipped sports courts, well-designed streets, and walkable residential environment also have significant correlations with green travel frequency and physical activities . According to existing literature, the academia has reached a consensus on how destination accessibility and distance influence the residents' physical activities: the higher the accessibility of destinations, the shorter the travel distance, the more likely that people would travel on foot or by bike, and the more physical activities they will have . According to Kerr, Galvez, Wendel et al., people's walking is positively correlated to sidewalks connection. A clearer street network helps increase physical activities like walking or biking . Children and teenagers would participate more in outdoor activities when they believe there is a safe and large activity space .\n\nMental health is usually reflected in two aspects, namely positive development and no psychological disorders . Positive development means realizing subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, intelligence, and emotional potentials . Subjective wellbeing is often known as a person's subjective feelings affected by his or her possession of environmental resources during his or her interactions with the external environment and is closely related with subjective behaviors . It could be influenced by various factors, which can be summarized into two aspects: external environment characteristics  and individual characteristics . Good built environment design can guide the living state of residents and thus affect the subjective well-being. In research on built environment and subjective well-being by Dong and others, a higher degree of mixed land use improves living convenience and thus people's well-being . Ma and Rao believed that a higher land-use mixing degree may be beneficial to improve residents' happiness due to its convenience . Neil Harris and Huw Thomas also found that diversified public activity places and perfect entertainment facilities can improve the quality of life and happiness of residents . Su and Zhou believed that the increase in the number of daily living facilities can\nimprove residents' subjective well-being . But other studies have found no significant relationship between diversity and happiness . While the correlations between subjective well-being and accessibility of destinations, including accessibility to medical facilities, entertainment, accessible stores, and education institutions, vary in different research regions and groups. However, most existing  show positive relationships between subjective well-being and accessibility of destinations . Ambrey and Fleming believed that in the design of urban built environment, green landscape also has a positive effect on people's mental health and well-being . According to Ballas and Tranmer, a good security situation can often improve the subjective well-being of individuals .\n\nFrom the perspective of behavior studies, human sense of well-being could result from various behaviors for various reasons. In addition to directly affecting people's physical activity and subjective well-being, built environment can also have indirect effects on subjective well-being through sports participation behavior. From the perspective of \"social psychology,\" people's psychological perception should include happiness, which is the unique experiences going through by individuals . Sports participation can eliminate mental tension and stress, reduce depression, enhance physical fitness, and thus produce subjective well-being . From the perspective of \"social capital,\" through social interaction and social communication with others in the process of sports participation, individuals can gain social capital like trust or social support , which in turn could escalate individual's happiness level . Most of the empirical  also show that sports participation has a certain positive effect on subjective well-being . In Craveiro and Erin's research, they pointed out that accessibility to public space like green land and parks not only directly promotes human health but also indirectly by creating opportunities for outdoor physical activities, and increasing social interactions and community participation . Florindo studied the relationship between leisuretime walking and the presence of public open spaces such as parks, bike paths and squares, and showed positive correlation between promotion of physical activity among adults and the existence of aforementioned open spaces . However, some other scholars found that such effects on health were overestimated. For example, Kawachi and Berkman thought that health-promotion environment may not bring much improvement in public health, while collective community operation, which includes culture and norms, community integration, community support system, etc. turns out to be a more decisive social factor for individual health .\n\nUrbanization, fast growing population, gathering of industries in big cities have caused huge demands for all type of resources\nand have led to a series of environmental issues, and they are becoming a great impact on living environments of human being as well as threatening human being's safety and health. As design for healthy living has become a new trend in developed countries, it is important to emphasis public health as a crucial option in urban residential built environment design and construction . Although many scholars from highly urbanized countries have found significant correlations between built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being in their research. However, the impact mechanism of the built environment on people's physical and mental health is very complex, due to comprehensive impact of cultural, social and economic conditions and personal lifestyle. On the one hand, for the action of built environment on physical activity and subjective well-being, the impact mechanism is still weak, and the impact path is still not clear enough. On the other hand, these  cannot be directly referenced from cities with high population density in developed countries as most of them are in Europe and the US where there is sparse population and advanced economy. The Yangtze River Delta region is the area with the highest degree of urbanization, the densest urban distribution and the fastest population growth in China. It is also the area with rapid growth of urban expansion. The population growth rate is fast and the density is relatively concentrated. The convergence of population, land, and capital in cities had boosted the continuous outward expansion of urban . Therefore, it is of great significance to study how to build urban residential built environment of the cities in the Yangtze River Delta of China to promote public health during unban expansion. The  could be referenced for other rapidly expanding cities especially cities in those developing countries with similar urban expansion scale as in the Yangtze River Delta of China.\n\nThis study, based on the existing research  in domestic and foreign academia and by using the micro research paradigm of individual behaviors, proposed a theoretical framework featuring \"built environment - physical activity - subjective wellbeing\" after investigating the complicated correlations among the residents' daily behaviors, the multi-dimensional geographic environment characteristics, and subjective well-being. In this analysis model, individual characteristics are the controlled variables, built environment characteristics are the independent variables, and physical activities and subjective well-being are the dependent variables . Based on the analysis above, three hypotheses are put forward as follows:\n\nHypothesis : Built environment characteristics have a positive effect on the residents' physical activities.\n\nHypothesis : Built environment characteristics have a positive effect on the residents' subjective well-being.\n\nHypothesis : Physical activities have a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and built environment characteristics.\n\nFIGURE \nTheoretical framework of \"Environment-Activity-Health.\"",

Hereby the expanding cities mainly refer to mega cities, super-large cities, and large cities with urban population over  million , and they have the potential to have a growing population in the near future. According to the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration Development Plan approved by the State Council in , the Yangtze River Delta will be built into a world-class urban agglomeration of world-class quality by . In the future, regional population and economic factors will further gather, urban space will further expand, and the environmental impact of urbanization will further intensify. Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Hefei, as important cities in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, have witnessed rapid growth in urbanization rate in recent years.

        "12": " \n\nResidential built environment characteristics were measured with the abbreviated form of Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale  by Cerin et al. to evaluate the respondents' perception of their residential areas related to physical activities . The scale has been verified to be effective when used in Chinese Mainland . It includes  items in  dimensions, namely proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, street connectivity, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security. Proximity to supporting facilities means whether there are outdoor courts, indoor sports venues, sidewalks or cycling roads nearby and\nwhether the sports equipment is available,  questions in total. Accessibility of destinations refers to the accessibility from the residential area to public areas like sports venues, squares, bus stations, shopping malls, and parks,  questions in total. Street connectivity refers to the number of crossroads and streets, and the conditions of street lighting, pavement, and hygiene, which reflect the convenience of accessing public areas like sports venues, shopping malls, and parks,  questions in total. Overall environmental aesthetics is the aesthetic attraction of the surrounding natural environment, buildings, greenness, and public green sidewalks,  questions in total. And public security is the security level of the residential area and its traffic conditions,  questions in total. The scale is designed in five-point style, where  stands for \"totally disagree,\"  for \"disagree a little,\"  for \"neutral,\"  for \"agree a little,\" and  for \"totally agree.\" The score of each dimension is the average score of all items in each dimension.

        "27": " \n\nAs China is under rapid development of urbanization, people have raised more diversified and personalized demands for urban lives, which are also reflected in their varying demands towards built environment. This study has proved that residents with different individual characteristics may have different levels of perception and usage of built environment . This result is consistent with Cao et al., that compared with men, women are more sensitive in perceiving the microenvironment . The reason may be that as a\nvulnerable group, women are also more sensitive to environment security. The research also shows that the young and middle-aged people  are less satisfied with the overall built environment while the teenagers present the greatest satisfaction. This result is consistent with Wu et al., that it is maybe because the young and middle-aged people bear more pressure and responsibility for work and family. Also, their requirements for built environment may be higher than the teenagers' . The high-income people show a relatively high level of satisfaction towards built environment and the low-income the least. Probably because people with higher income live in better communities with more convenient public transportation, public services, and facilities such as sports venues.\n\nIndividual characteristics including gender, age, educational attainment, and income all have an impact on the residents' participation in physical activities . This study has proved that people with different individual characteristics have different intensities of physical activities. Most research has concluded that lack of physical activities is more likely to happen to women than to men , but some attributed that to a regional issue. The study of Qiao show that in some regional men are less physically active than women . According to analyses of this study, men have fewer physical activities than women. Meanwhile,\namong different age groups, those between  to  years old have more physical activities than others. The reason may partially lie in retirement. Lahti et al. found that men near retirement would increase the time spent on medium-level physical activities by  min every week and women by  min . In France, regardless of gender, people spend  more hours in physical activities every week after retirement . In China, most women retire at the age of  and men at the age of  . The retired people, especially women who retire much earlier than men, have more spare time for more physical activities. Individual characteristics of educational attainment and income present a non-linear pattern. But overall, people with undergraduate degrees or above tend to have higher intensity of physical activities than those less educated, which may be related to their awareness of the importance of physical activities. This result is consistent with Prochaska et al., that people with higher educational attainment are more likely to engage in mental work or jobs that require little physical strength. Although having fewer chances of commuting by walking or cycling, they would have more leisure physical activities as they know it is important to do so .\n\nThe residents' individual characteristics, namely gender, age, educational attainment, and income also have a significant impact on their subjective well-being . This study has proved the relevant hypothesis. This result is consistent with the study of Gerdtham, Lin and McBride et al. Compared with men, women are easier to develop a sense of well-being . A \"U\" type correlation, which decreases first and increases later, was found between age and subjective wellbeing . People with higher educational attainment would have greater subjective well-being. And higher income could also effectively improve subjective well-being .",
        "28": " \n\nFactors that may influence people's physical activities are complicated and keep changing over time. The socio-ecological model regards residential built environment and public facilities as two of these factors. For example, sufficient convenient public facilities, a beautiful environment, high-level public security, low traffic flow, etc. could encourage the residents to have more physical activities . Therefore, residential built environment is an important influencing factor of physical activities. This study verified the significant correlations between the residents' physical activities and the five residential built environment characteristics, namely proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, street connectivity, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security. Also, residential built environment's direct effect on the elderly residents was proved with structural equation model.\n\nBesides, in this study, residents of the active group are more satisfied with factors including proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, and public security than those of the inactive group. And it is found that people would have more physical activities when there are sufficient convenient supporting facilities, easy-to-access sports venues, and high public security level. This result is consistent with those concluded by scholars in foreign academia. For example, Jansen et al. concluded that, better public facilities, especially entertainment facilities could increase the adults' physical activities and thus improve their health . According to Van and others, safe traffic and convenient public supporting facilities that are easy to access are also conducive to the residents' physical activities . From the above, it can be inferred that a community with good sports facilities, venues, and public areas like parks and squares that are suitable for sports exercises, as well as high public security level and low traffic flow has a certain strength in enhancing people's motivation for sports exercises and improving their status of physical activities.\n\nNo significant correlation was found between physical activities and the rest two built environment characteristics, namely overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity. Though in some research, more streets and better street connectivity could encourage walking or cycling trips as the travel distance gets shorter and people have more choices of traveling routes . Some scholars concluded that street connectivity is negatively related to the residents' walking. In an environment of high street connectivity, the elderly would have a reduced sense of security towards public transport and thus spend less time on physical activities every week . It may be because overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity emphasize more the improvement of urban greenness and sceneries as well as traffic conditions, which are aimed either to enhance the community's ecological and esthetical functions or to reduce its traffic jams and potential traffic danger. Providing more areas for physical activities is not the priority in the planning of overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity. Instead, it may weaken the residents' enthusiasm for physical activities. Hence, tests on the correlations between physical activities, overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity could draw different .",
        "29": " \n\nSubjective well-being receives multiple influences from both the physical environment and the subjective social environment. The influencing factors could be temporal-special behaviors or the multidimensional geographical environment. For example, land use mix, convenience and accessibility of public facilities, traffic connectivity, and the overall environmental aesthetics could improve residential subjective well-being . Therefore, residential built environment is an important factor that may influence subjective well-being. This study verified the significant correlations between the residents' subjective well-being and the five residential built\nenvironment characteristics, namely proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, street connectivity, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security. Also, the direct effect of residential built environment on subjective well-being was proved with structural equation model.\n\nMeanwhile, this study proved that subjective well-being has significant positive correlations with accessibility of destinations, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security. Good accessibility of destinations, which includes accessibility to sports venues, public facilities, parks, green land, etc., a beautiful environment, and high public security level could improve the residents' subjective well-being. This result goes in line with those drawn by scholars in foreign academia. For example, Gao et al. proposed that short distance between destinations in daily travel encourages positive means of transportation and increases interpersonal interactions, which helps improve people's mental health . Andrew and Dong et al. proposed that in a beautiful environment or a green area where there is more space and opportunities for physical activities and chances to interact with others, people can better improve their interpersonal relationships and mental health . Frank et al. believe crimes are more likely to happen in an environment with poor public security. When people feel unsafe about the environment, they would bear more mental pressure and would not prefer walking or cycling trips . That's because, in urban residential built environment, convenient facilities and high public security level are important premises for human interactions and connections. And green landscape inspires people's curiosity and desire for exploration, which enhances residential well-being as well as social interactions and neighborhood unity.\n\nNo significant correlation was found between subjective wellbeing and the rest two built environment characteristics, namely proximity to supporting facilities and street connectivity. Though in some research, a high rate of land use could increase the residents' subjective well-being as it makes the supporting facilities more convenient to use . Some others believed diversity has no significant relationship with subjective well-being. According to Cao, land used mix provides the residents with diversified destinations but simultaneously makes the community noisy and crowded, so its positive and negative impacts cancel each other out . The situation is similar in the case of street connectivity. Although as noted by Leslie et al. research, higher street connectivity and crossroad density encourage walking trips and social interactions and improve mental health by creating a safe walking environment where cars drive much more slowly . But some research found street design may restrict residential mental health. For example, according to the research on low-income people in Southeast America by James et al., community walkability is positively correlated to depression, which is particularly true in poor areas. Because areas with high walkability are more likely to have problems like pollution and crimes, which may increase people's mental pressure and thus impair mental health . In , subjective well-being could be influenced by multiple factors such as built\nenvironment, social environment, and individual factors. And for different built environment characteristics, their impacts may be multi-dimensional and contradictory. That explains why the research  of correlations between residential built environment characteristics and the residents' subjective well-being vary from one another.",
        "30": " \n\nThe mediator model of this study found that, physical activities have a direct effect on subjective well-being and a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and residential built environment. Physical activity played a complete mediating role in Proximity to supporting facilities and Subjective well-being. Overall environmental aesthetics and Public security not only directly affect residents' subjective well-being, but also have indirect effects on subjective well-being through physical activities. It may be because subjective well-being could be influenced by residential built environment through influence on commuting and individual health. This result goes in line with those drawn by scholars in foreign academia. For example, Craveiro and Erin et al. thought that with a higher accessibility of supporting facilities, and shorter commuting distance, the residents are more likely to choose green travel and thus have more physical activities, which in turn improve interpersonal interactions, mental health, and subjective well-being. People would commute more by walking when the community has various parks, squares, and green space, which improves health by creating more physical activities. People would also have enhanced subjective well-being after spending more time on physical activities and social interactions . In a beautiful environment or a green area where there is more space and opportunities for physical activities and chances to interact with others, people can better improve their interpersonal relationships and mental health . Meanwhile, a clear street network, safe traffic, and high public security level increase physical activities by encouraging the residents to commute by walking and enhance people's physical and mental health as they feel safe and more comfortable when having sports activities.\n\nTaken together, future planning on the construction of residential built environment in cities can be approached in the following aspects:  Under the backdrop of rapid urbanization, the residential built environment in cities shall try best to satisfy the needs of different social strata, especially the elderly, the female, the low-income, and the less educated groups. We shall maximize the aggregate of happiness by enhancing policy support for the improvement of old urban communities and the optimization of built environment that faces the whole society . Supporting facilities for living and physical activities shall be easy to use and access with a diversified functional layout, so as to meet the various needs of the residents . Planning of\nactivity venues in the residential area shall take full consideration of building practicability, environmental openness, and landscape aesthetics. Space and environment design are not only visual aesthetics for the residents, but also bear the responsibility to realize harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Outdoor built environment would be used more when people perceive a shorter distance to nature . Street connectivity and security shall be improved with reasonable planning of public areas and outdoor activity space such as squares, parks, and green sidewalks. Measures shall be taken to reduce traffic flow and speed of motorized vehicles, so as to create a comfortable and safe environment for walking and cycling. It is also important to set up enough accessible facilities to meet the travelling needs of the vulnerable.",
        "31": " \n\nFirst, the study used a cross-sectional survey to explore the correlations between residential built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being in cities of Yangtze River Delta. As it did not conduct longitudinal research, the  cannot explain the mutual influence between the variables. Second, this study used subjective measurements. While in future research, more objective research  shall be considered to produce more objective , such as GIS for the measure of built environment and accelerometer for physical activities. Third, in the next step, social environment and neighborhood relationship could be researched as another two influencing factors of physical activities and subjective well-being, so as to optimize the correlation model of residential built environment, physical activities, and subjective well-being.",
        "32": " \n\nLin and Yang  residents with different individual characteristics may have different levels of perception and usage of built environment . The intensity of physical activities has significant positive correlations with proximity to supporting facilities, accessibility of destinations, and public security , while no significant correlation with overall environmental aesthetics and street connectivity . The residents' subjective well-being has significant positive correlations with accessibility of destinations, overall environmental aesthetics, and public security , while no significant correlation with proximity to supporting facilities and street connectivity . Built environment characteristics have a direct effect on the residents' physical activities and subjective well-being, with an effect value of . and . , respectively. Physical activities not only have a direct effect on subjective wellbeing, with an effect value of . , but also a mediating effect on the correlations between subjective well-being and built environment characteristics, which accounts for  of the total effect . Physical activity played a complete\nmediating role in Proximity to supporting facilities and Subjective well-being. Overall environmental aesthetics and Public security not only directly affect residents' subjective well-being, but also have indirect effects on subjective well-being through physical activities. The indirect effect value accounted for . and  of the total effect value."
