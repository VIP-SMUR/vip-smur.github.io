        "2": " \n\nIMPORTANCE Neighborhood physical conditions have been associated with mental illness and may partially explain persistent socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence of poor mental health.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate whether interventions to green vacant urban land can improve selfreported mental health.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This citywide cluster randomized trial examined  community-dwelling sampled adults living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, within  vacant lot clusters randomly assigned to  study groups. Participants were followed up for  months preintervention and postintervention. This trial was conducted from October , , to November , . Data were analyzed from July , , to April , .\n\nINTERVENTIONS The greening intervention involved removing trash, grading the land, planting new grass and a small number of trees, installing a low wooden perimeter fence, and performing regular monthly maintenance. The trash cleanup intervention involved removal of trash, limited grass mowing where possible, and regular monthly maintenance. The control group received no intervention.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported mental health measured by the Kessler- Psychological Distress Scale and the components of this scale.\n\n A total of  clusters containing  vacant lots were enrolled in the trial and randomly allocated to the following  of  study groups: the greening intervention , the trash cleanup intervention , or no intervention . Of the  participants, the mean  age was .  years,   were female, and   had a family income less than  $, as well as a nonsignificant reduction in overall selfreported poor mental health . For participants living in neighborhoods below the poverty line, the greening intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in feeling depressed . Intention-to-treat analysis of those living near the trash cleanup intervention compared with no intervention showed no significant changes in self-reported poor mental health.",

        "5": " \n\nAlmost  in  US adults report some form of mental illness. Depression is the second largest contributor to years lived with disability in the United States,  with more than  million adults experiencing an episode annually.  Yet patient mental health services only account for an estimated \\% of total medical care spending in the United States.  A broadening of treatment options to improve mental health is necessary, including interventions that fundamentally change harmful environmental surroundings that may be key contributors to mental illness.\n\nNeighborhood physical conditions, including vacant or dilapidated spaces, trash, and lack of quality infrastructure such as sidewalks and parks, are associated with depression  and are factors that may explain the persistent prevalence of mental illness in resource-limited communities.  Vacant and dilapidated spaces are unavoidable neighborhood conditions that residents in low-resource communities encounter every day, making the very existence of these spaces a constant source of stress  and possibly mental illness.\n\nHowever, neighborhood physical conditions can also positively influence mental health.  Spending time and living near green spaces have been associated with various improved mental health outcomes, including less depression, anxiety, and stress.  Several studies have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between more time spent in green spaces and lower depression rates.  Therefore, green space may be a potential buffer between inequitable neighborhood conditions and poor mental health outcomes. \n\nWhile patient-level therapies for mental illness will always be a vital aspect of treatment, changing the places where people live, work, and play may have broad population-level effects on mental health outcomes.  There have been calls for the development of urban environmental interventions to improve mental health outcomes and well-being.  In support of this, a number of observational studies have demonstrated the positive effect of vacant land greening interventions on urban health, crime, and stress.  However, these prior studies have not been experimental and have not tested mental health outcomes. Given this, we evaluated data from, to our knowledge, the first citywide cluster randomized trial with the objective to test the effects of inexpensive, standardized, and reproducible vacant land remediation interventions--greening and trash cleanup-on health and safety. We report here on the mental health outcomes. Analysis of crime outcomes is reported elsewhere. ",
        "7": " \nThis citywide cluster randomized trial of a standardized, reproducible vacant lot greening intervention and vacant lot trash cleanup intervention was conducted in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The University of Pennsylvania institutional review board approved this trial. All participants provided written informed consent. All sections of this article were written using the Consolidated\nStandards of Reporting Trials  reporting guideline.  The trial protocol can be found in the Supplement.",
        "8": "  \n\nA master list was compiled of all vacant lots citywide available from the city administrative records throughout January . Vacant lots that were authorized by municipal ordinance as blighted and eligible for the intervention were randomly sampled for the trial. Eligible lots were included if they specifically  had existing violations signaling blight, including illegal dumping, abandoned cars, and/or unmanaged vegetation growth; and  had been abandoned, as confirmed through contact with the owner of record who, within a -day period, either authorized the intervention or did not reply. Owners included the city itself for publicly owned lots. We excluded lots that had insufficient blight or lack of abandonment, lots that were greater than  sq ft, and lots that were fully paved parking lots.\n\nVacant lot clusters served as the intervention unit for the study. To form these clusters, the master list of eligible vacant lots was ordered based on the assignment of random numbers within  sections of the city.  In each section of the city, the first vacant lot in the randomly ordered list was chosen as an index lot and a . -mile radius buffer was created around that lot. All other eligible vacant lots on the master list that fell within this radius were used to form a cluster grouping of geographically proximal vacant lots that summed between  to  total sq ft; these lots were then removed from consideration as future index lots. This process then cycled to the next randomly ordered index lot on the list that was at least . miles away from the edge of prior clusters until all clusters were formed. This process guaranteed that no clusters overlapped, reducing potential spillover and contamination effects across trial arms.\n\nWithin each city section, clusters were randomly assigned to  of  study groups-the greening intervention, trash cleanup intervention, or no intervention . A repeated randomization procedure  was used under a predetermined protocol that permitted repeated random allocation of the  study groups until a statistically significant balance was achieved with a set of potential confounding variables, including the total area and mean separating distance of the study vacant lots, the total vacant lots, resident population, and number of serious crimes , in each cluster.",
        "9": " \n\nThe vacant lot greening intervention involved the cleaning and greening of vacant lots via a standard, reproducible process of removing trash and debris, grading the land, planting new grass and a small number of trees, installing a low wooden perimeter fence with openings, and performing regular maintenance . The vacant lot trash cleanup intervention group involved removal of trash and debris, limited grass mowing on the lot where possible, and regular maintenance. The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society designed and carried out the interventions over a -month period, from April , , to May , , followed by monthly maintenance. At the end of the postintervention period, vacant lots assigned to the control condition were scheduled for cleaning and greening.",
        "10": " n\nTwo preintervention interview survey waves were conducted from October , , to March , , and  postintervention survey waves were conducted from June , , to November , , with a sample of residents from each cluster. All participants completed at least  preintervention survey and  postintervention survey. The outer-bounding polygon and its centroid were calculated for each grouping of vacant lots per cluster. This centroid represented the point location that was mathematically closest to all the study vacant lots in each cluster. The address of the closest building to this point location was then determined as the starting point for house-tohouse random sampling and enrollment of survey participants. At each starting address, a -person\nsurvey team walked in a predetermined random direction on the corresponding city block followed by randomly chosen adjacent city blocks within the cluster until a total of  participants had been identified, consented, and were interviewed. Both the survey team and participants were blinded to cluster intervention. Participants were told the study was about improving our understanding of urban health. One participant per household was chosen; in households with multiple eligible participants, the individual with the most recent birthday was chosen. All baseline interviews and most follow-up interviews were conducted in person; a handful of follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone. Both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking individuals  years and older were administered the survey in the language of their choice; only  Spanish-language surveys were administered. Each participant was compensated  . ",
        "11": "  \n\nAt each interview, participants responded to questions about their perceptions of mental health, focusing on their experiences within the past  days to anchor responses in time relative to the intervention period and to avoid telescoping and overestimation. We used the validated short-form Kessler- Psychological Distress Scale , a widely used community screening tool. The K was designed to evaluate the prevalence of serious mental illness in the community and does not make a\n\nFigure .

Participants were asked to indicate how often they felt nervous, hopeless, restless, depressed, that everything was an effort, and worthless using the following scale: all of the time, most of the time, more than half of the time, less than half of the time, some of the time, or at no time. In keeping with the K order and scoring, the  middle categories were combined to create a score of  to  for each marker, which was then summed for a total score of  to  . Using standard scoring guidelines, a score of  or greater indicated higher prevalence of serious mental illness or what we call self-reported poor mental health.  Participants self-reported their race and/or ethnicity.",
        "12": "  \n\nPrior to the study, sample size was determined by taking into account anticipated intracluster correlation, participant response prevalence, number of crimes reported to the police in each area, effect size, and power. The minimally detectable effect size, given  power and  time points based on the group before vs after interaction test for any pairwise comparison among the randomly allocated groups of lots, was calculated.  From this, and predicting a  loss-to-follow-up rate, we estimated that we would maintain more than  power if we randomly surveyed  people per cluster twice before and twice after the intervention.\n\nIntention-to-treat analyses of participants were conducted according to the randomly assigned vacant lot cluster intervention group in which they lived. Pairwise comparisons were completed for all study outcomes between the greening intervention group and the no intervention group as well as the trash cleanup intervention group and the no intervention group. These pairwise comparisons were tested for statistical significance  using unadjusted random-effects, cross-sectional time series regressions that accounted for the cluster design of the trial. Random-effects regressions were chosen because we assumed that\n\nFigure . Vacant Lot Main Greening Intervention\n\nImages show blighted preperiod conditions and remediated postperiod restorations.

The trash cleanup intervention was not associated with a reduction in feeling depressed or selfreported poor mental health.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first citywide cluster randomized trial of actual place-based changes to urban spaces. These  add much needed experimental evidence to a growing body of literature calling for structural changes to neighborhoods as a method for improving health and safety.  This study extends previous work showing a clear association between green space and mental illness,  by demonstrating that adding green space to people's neighborhood environment can improve the trajectory of their mental health. Additionally, vacant lot greening is a relatively low-cost intervention  that we have previously shown to be a cost-beneficial solution to firearm violence.  For these reasons, vacant lot greening may be an extremely attractive intervention for policy makers seeking to address urban blight.\n\nOur findings indicate that the effect of vacant lot greening on feeling depressed was slightly stronger for those living in neighborhoods below the poverty line. Urban blight is an environmental condition that disproportionately affects low-resource neighborhoods, as evidenced by the fact that almost half of our participants had yearly family incomes less than  Countering this with clear signs of neighborhood investment, such as a clearly marked newly greened vacant lot, may contribute to the improvements seen in feeling depressed and self-reported poor mental health.",
        "18": "  \n\nThere were several limitations to this study. We used the K to measure our outcome of interest and mental health. While this is a validated and widely used scale, it is still a single scale, and other mental illness screening and diagnosis tools and scales may produce different . Furthermore, we did not conduct a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-level diagnosis of mental illness but rather used a community screening tool. Another limitation is the duration of our study and loss to follow-up. We followed up people for  months following the blight remediation interventions and are unable to know if the effect of the interventions on mental health outcomes persisted past the study period. We also made every effort to minimize loss to follow-up of our study participants after they were first enrolled, although differential, nonrandom dropout in our  study arms and across all study waves could have affected our . Finally, we did not specifically track if and how study participants used  study vacant lots, although prior work has demonstrated signs of use, such as barbeques or chairs on similar vacant lots.

The treatment of dilapidated physical environments can be an important tool for communities to address persistent mental health problems. These findings provide support to health care clinicians concerned with positively transforming the often chaotic and harmful environments that affect their patients. Our findings also offer evidence to policy makers interested in increasing municipal investments in the remediation of blighted urban spaces as an inexpensive  and scalable way to improve mental health, particularly in low-resource neighborhoods.\n\n\n:    ARTICLE INFORMATION\n    Accepted for Publication: April , .\n    Published: July , . doi:./jamanetworkopen..\n    Correction: This article was corrected on August , , to fix an error in Figure B.\n    Open Access: This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the CC-BY License.
