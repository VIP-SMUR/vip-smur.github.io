However, the empirical evidence over the last decade has been inconclusive, usually with flawed study designs. OBJECTIVE: This study explored whether a 'green' building leads to a healthier, more productive work environment. : A one-year, longitudinal comparison of two groups of employees of a large commercial bank; a group that moved into a GreenStar-accredited building and a group that stayed in a conventional building, was conducted. Measures of psychological wellbeing, physical wellbeing, productivity, and perceptions of the physical environment were taken before the move, six months later, and one year later. :  indicate that the 'green' building group had significantly increased self-reported productivity and physical wellbeing. The perceptions of the physical work environment indicate that respondents in the 'green' building group experienced significant air quality improvements  but perceived the lighting conditions as dimmer. : Despite positive findings 'green' building rating tools require amendment to focus on those qualities that actually lead to improved wellbeing and productivity.\n\n\n GreenStar accreditation, self-reported productivity, absenteeism, workplace indoor environmental quality",
        "3": " . \n\nThe term 'green ergonomics' has only recently been defined . Hedge  first used the term in the title of his article to the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society  Bulletin to introduce the contribution of ergonomics to 'green' building design. Hanson  used the term for her Donald Broadbent lecture at the Institute of Human Factors and Ergonomics conference\n\nin , but did not specifically define the term. She suggested that 'green ergonomics' could look at the design of: 'green' jobs, low energy systems and products, transport systems and vehicles, buildings and urban environments, communication systems, and retail systems. Thatcher  defined 'green ergonomics' as ensuring human and natural system wellbeing through understanding the bi-directional relationships between natural systems and human systems. Using this definition, 'green' buildings should be built to ensure the wellbeing of natural systems as well as ensuring the wellbeing of the building's occupants. Using a different term, Steimle and Zink  defined 'human factors and sustainable development' as a broader concept that invites ergonomics to include economic, social, and environmental factors into the ergonomics design process. However, the term 'human factors and sustainable development' has been widely interpreted in recent years and is still gaining theoretical stability . Within this broader definition, 'green ergonomics' might therefore be considered to be primarily concerned with the impact of ergonomics on ameliorating the negative impacts of humans on the natural environment, although it must be acknowledged that this definition is not yet widely entrenched or accepted. This study looks at one of the possible contributions that 'green ergonomics' can make; specifically the design and operation of environmentally sustainable 'green' buildings. Several authors  have noted a number of different points at which ergonomics principles and  can contribute to improving 'green' building design. These include: the ergonomics of 'green' building construction  and building maintenance, ergonomics factors related to demolition , designing for sustainable work that ensures comfort and safety, understanding how 'green' buildings are used by their occupants, and understanding how 'green' building design innovations influence actual occupant behaviour. This study falls into the latter category; understanding how 'green' building design aspects such as environmental comfort, personal control, and energy efficiency impact on the wellbeing and productivity of building occupants.",
        "4": " .. \n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency  defines 'green' buildings as \"the practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle\". This is achieved through efficiently using resources , ensuring occupant health and increasing productivity, and reducing the impact of outputs on the environment  . This means taking a holistic approach that takes into account building materials, building design itself, and the need for sustainable work. Qualifying as a 'green' building usually involves some form of rating against objective criteria. Internationally, the last two decades have seen the emergence of a number of voluntary benchmarks and standards to guide the promotion, design and operation of 'green' buildings. Such rating tools include the British Establishment Environmental Assessment Method , the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design , GreenStar Australia,\n\nGreenStar South Africa, and the National Australian Built Environment Rating System  amongst a number of other rating tools. 'Green' building rating tools award credits for building lifecycle elements including: the choice of building site and the ecology of that site , the choice of materials, design innovations that minimize resource use  and reduce emissions , and how a building integrates with other human and environmental services such as transport networks .\n\nThe recognition of a healthy, comfortable, and productive work environment is also an important element of these rating tools, usually captured as a dimension called indoor environmental quality . Indoor environmental quality encourages building designers to incorporate features that will improve occupants' wellbeing and productivity through better use of daylight, external views, improved ventilation systems, more 'fresh' air and less recycled air, better light quality , noise reduction, better thermal comfort ranges, increased personal control of environmental conditions, and reduced toxins in the air . Within the LEED rating tool, an innovation credit can also be obtained for following good ergonomics design of the building interior as well as for introducing ergonomics training programmes . This credit is not, however, available within the GreenStar rating tool used to evaluate the 'green' building in this study. Instead an innovation strategy credit was awarded in the GreenStar South Africa rating tool for investigating how productivity and occupant wellbeing would be influenced by a move to a 'green' building.\n\nThe inclusion of indoor environmental quality as a rating tool dimension is based on empirical research exploring the impact on health and performance appearing extensively in the environmental health , environmental engineering , environmental psychology , and environmental ergonomics  literature. Based on this body of literature it is widely believed  that 'green' buildings are more comfortable, healthier, and produce higher levels of productivity than conventional buildings. However, Heerwagen and Zagreus  have noted that these claims have not always been consistently supported by empirical evidence.",
        "5": " .. \n\nDespite widespread claims for the superiority of 'green' buildings there are a limited number of detailed evaluations involving the impact on building occupants available in the public domain . While empirical evidence for productivity gains in 'green' buildings is relatively well-established, the relationships for physical and psychological wellbeing emerge less clearly. Early case studies of green buildings produced consistent evidence that 'green' buildings increased productivity , reduced absenteeism , and improved building user satisfaction levels . In one building  the claim was for a  increase in productivity. A more common claim is for productivity gains of under  . More recently, support for the impact of 'green' buildings on productivity, while still generally favorable, is more mixed. Some studies have found no significant differences in perceived productivity  or absenteeism , while other studies have demonstrated increases in perceived productivity  or reduced absenteeism . Generally, studies that report on improved productivity either use absenteeism as a proxy for productivity  or asked respondents to indicate how much their work environment has improved their productivity . The most comprehensive study assessing productivity directly  found evidence for increased typing speed and lawyers' billing amounts, reduced absenteeism, but not self-reported productivity. Other than perceptions of the physical environment, only four studies could be found that examined the impact of a 'green' building on the psychological wellbeing or physical wellbeing of building occupants. Heerwagen  found that motivation, job satisfaction, emotional wellbeing and social wellbeing at work increased for daytime workers in a 'green' building. Paevere and Brown  reported that physical wellbeing in the 'green' building was high but provided no data on comparative measures of physical wellbeing. Thatcher and Milner  found no significant improvements for psychological wellbeing, physical wellbeing, job satisfaction, or propensity to stay in the organization in a 'green' building. Hedge and Dorsey  found evidence for positive perceptions of health and performance in two 'green' buildings but their study design did not allow statistical comparisons. No other studies could be found that examined the impact of a 'green' building on the physical and psychological wellbeing of building occupants despite\nthe fact that Heerwagen  identified these aspects as important components in evaluating the organizational success of 'green' buildings.\n\nStudies that have looked at user satisfaction with the physical environment generally find positive occupant satisfaction ratings for 'green' buildings , thermal comfort , and lighting conditions  but that the office temperature was problematic . Thatcher and Milner  found in their study  that the 'green' building was less noisy and thermal comfort was better but that lighting aspects were significantly worse. This lack of consistency in the  would suggest that there are some design aspects of 'green' buildings or some aspects of the work context that are more important in determining positive reactions to the physical environment. For example, Heerwagen  found significant differences between different groups of workers in satisfaction with the physical environment, but only for the office workers who worked during the day and not for shiftworkers. She found that respondents across-the-board felt overworked at the end of a work shift. Heerwagen  argued that \"it's not how green you make it - it's what you make green\" . No studies have systematically evaluated which design aspects of 'green' buildings have the largest impact on occupant satisfaction levels.\n\nStudies that draw comparisons between 'green' buildings also produce inconclusive . Abbaszadeh et al.  for example compared  'green' buildings to  'non-green' buildings and found that users were most satisfied with thermal comfort and air quality, neutral on noise and lighting conditions , and dissatisfied with light levels and privacy. Fowler and Rauch  examined  'green' buildings and found that while satisfaction with the indoor environment was generally high, satisfaction with noise levels and thermal comfort was lower than national benchmarks. The US Green Building Council  report examined  LEED-accredited buildings and found that these buildings were higher than the national average on satisfaction scores  but lower than the national average for thermal comfort and noise. Leaman et al.  compared  'green' buildings to  conventional buildings and found that the 'green' buildings were rated sig-\nnificantly lower on thermal comfort, noise, and some lighting conditions . Paul and Taylor  examined two 'non-green' buildings and a GreenStaraccredited building and found no significant differences on satisfaction ratings, except for thermal comfort where the 'green' building was perceived to be significantly warmer. Moschandreas and Nuanual  compared  LEED-certified buildings to  conventional buildings and concluded that the 'green' buildings were better than traditional buildings on four characteristics, the same on three characteristics, and worse on one characteristic. Unfortunately they did not provide details on which characteristics were different or the same.",
        "6": " .. \n\nFrom a methodological perspective most of the studies only provide evaluations using a post-occupancy measure . Only taking a postoccupancy measure tells us very little about what conditions were like before employees occupied the 'green' building. It could be that employees were already satisfied with building conditions before moving into a 'green' building or that productivity was already high. Some of the instruments ask respondents to draw comparisons with conditions from before the move to a 'green' building . This is an approach which might be open to several psychological biases including memory and recency biases. Evans  called for more longitudinal designs in order to understand the relationships between people and their wellbeing responses to the built environment. To date, the only longitudinal studies reporting direct comparisons before and after a move to a 'green' building are Sustainability Victoria  and Thatcher and Milner . There are other studies that have longitudinal components but which don't report both preand post-measures  or do not give statistical comparisons even if the numerical values are provided .\n\nMany of the studies do not include any comparison group at all  or draw comparisons with national benchmark databases  which may contain evaluations of buildings that are not comparable. Comparing 'green' buildings to conventional buildings  with only post occupancy measures  may be meaningless because employees in different buildings may be in different organizations, working in different industries, and doing different types of work. For example,\n\nPaul and Taylor  compared a 'green' building at one university with two 'green' buildings at another university. Differences in satisfaction ratings may have been due to the different organizational settings rather than a true reflection of the building. Only Paevere and Brown  and Thatcher and Milner  draw direct statistical comparisons between buildings in the same organization.",
        "7": " .. \n\nUsing a longitudinal, comparison group design, this study aimed to investigate if moving into a 'green' building improved productivity, psychological wellbeing, and physical wellbeing over working in a conventional building. In addition, this study also investigated whether perceptions of the physical working environment changed after moving into a 'green' building.",
        "9": " .. \n\nThe 'green' building under investigation was one of the first GreenStar-accredited buildings in South Africa. The 'green' building received a GreenStar fourstar rating of  credits  and   credits for the indoor environmental quality dimension. The indoor environmental quality aspects of the building included a ventilation system with a rate of fresh air intake  more than the national standard, a monitoring system for  levels connected to the ventilation system, lighting systems that reduced flicker and were movement sensitive, exterior design features to reduce glare from the sun, interior paints and carpeting with reduced VOC levels, no formaldehyde was used, no PVC was used, and  of the office area had exterior views. In addition, other 'green' building design features included a rain water catchment system, indigenous landscaping, a building user's guide, a  fly-ash component in cement for the building, and measures to encourage pedestrians and cyclists. The comparison buildings were two pre-existing office buildings which did not have a 'green' intent in their design. These buildings had air-conditioning systems but with no fresh air ventilation component and with no individual control of lighting or ventilation. These buildings were more than  years old and complied with local building legislation at that time but had no glare protection and no plant landscaping.",
        "10": " .. \n\nThe study was conducted in a large financial institution with more than  employees across the country. The new 'green' building could accommodate  staff members when fully occupied. The study design was longitudinal, with two groups: a treatment group where employees moved from existing buildings to the new 'green' building  and a contrast group where employees stayed in their existing building . Time  data were collected from  December  to  January  shortly before any employees moved to the 'green' building . Time  data were collected approximately six months after the 'green' building group had moved to the 'green' building from  May to  June . Time  data were collected approximately one year after the 'green' building group had moved to the 'green' building from  January to  February . A total of  emails were sent to two randomly selected samples from each of these groups . The email consisted of a short covering note inviting participation and a hyperlink to the online version of the survey. Volunteer respondents completed the survey online and clicked on the submit button at the end of the survey. Clicking the submit button was considered as consent to participate. At Time  there were  completed responses returned . Six months later emails were sent to all  email addresses again. At Time  there were  completed responses returned . At Time   the process was repeated and  completed responses were returned . This drop-off in response rate was expected. Studies consistently demonstrate that there is a large drop-out rate of respondents for longitudinal studies and that this may be worse with online surveys . Respondents were also asked to provide their employee number so that matching their responses at the three data collection points would be possible. At Time  there were  responses that could be matched to Time  . At Time ,  responses were received that could be matched to Time  and Time  .",

In the second part of the survey the primary variables of interest were assessed. These measures, except for tenure and chronic underlying illness, were taken at each time point. The following quantitative measures were used.\n\nPsychological wellbeing was assessed using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale  .

Student's t-tests were used to examine differences between the 'green' building group and the Other group on each variable at each data collection point. Due to the small sample sizes and the significant differences in the normal distribution of the variables in the matched sample, Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test for significant differences across the three data collection points and separate pair-wise Mann-Whitney  tests to compare the two groups at each data collection point.",

Both groups spent slightly longer than  hours per day in the building and around  hours per day at their work station. Both groups spent approximately  days per week in the building.

It is important to note that this may have been due to the fact that absenteeism was significantly higher in the Other group compared to the 'green' building group at Time . The Other group was not significantly different at Time  or Time  although absenteeism in the Other group was always higher. A similar trend was noted for selfreported productivity which was statistically higher for the 'green' building group at Time  but not at Time  or Time  despite being lower at each time point. The matched group produced a slightly different pattern for these productivity measures. While there were no statistically significant differences across the three data collection points for the Other group, the 'green' building group was significantly higher at Time   on self-reported productivity , moving from  at Time  , to  at Time , and  at Time  whereas the Other group showed a decline from  at Time  , to  at Time , and  at Time .\n\nOn the wellbeing measures, the Other group demonstrated significantly improved psychological wellbeing , physical wellbeing , and job satisfaction  from Time  to Time  in the unmatched sample whereas the 'green' building group only demonstrated significantly improved physical wellbeing .

On the matched sample, selfreported productivity for the 'green' building was significantly higher at Time  compared to Time   but not for absenteeism or presenteeism. This result for the matched group supports the findings of the majority of previous research  and specifically Romm and Browning's  findings of just under  improvement in productivity. For the unmatched sample, absenteeism decreased significantly for the Other group  while presenteeism decreased signifi-\ncantly for the 'green' building group, but only at Time . Sustainability Victoria  also found significant improvements in a smaller sub-sample  using 'hard' measures of productivity  but not on the measure of self-reported productivity. None of the productivity measures used in the current study were independent measures of productivity or performance but only self-reports of productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Heerwagen  noted that most organizations experience a drop in productivity when workers move. This would imply that even if productivity measures remain similar despite a major organizational intervention, such as a change in office building, this might actually be a positive indicator.\n\nFor the unmatched and the matched samples, psychological wellbeing did not significantly improve in the 'green' building group. Instead, psychological wellbeing and job satisfaction increased significantly over the study period in the Other group, but for the unmatched sample only. The lack of improvement in psychological wellbeing in the 'green' building is consistent with Thatcher and Milner  but not with Heerwagen , although she did not test for statistical significance and did not have a contrast group . The significant improvement in physical wellbeing was consistent across the matched and unmatched samples, although was also significantly higher in the unmatched sample for the Other group. These  support those of Hedge and Dorsey  who also found perceived improvement in physical wellbeing in their two 'green' buildings. Improvements in perceptions of physical wellbeing are also likely to translate into improvements in psychological wellbeing and productivity over time , provided the improvements are maintained. Only Thatcher and Milner  provided comparisons of perceived physical wellbeing in a 'green' building  and they found no significant improvements. Paevere and Brown  reported that physical wellbeing in a 'green' building was largely symptom-free but did not examine any preand post-occupancy changes in physical wellbeing.\n\nIt is quite difficult to draw comparisons between the  of this study and previous investigations because of the variety of 'green' building designs and research designs used to investigate their impact on building occupants. Nevertheless, the reduced efficacy of the lighting conditions  and increased perceptions of the air quality  are con-\nsistent findings in previous studies. Artificial lighting in 'green' buildings is often reduced to provide energy savings and this may mean that the interiors of 'green' buildings are perceived as dimmer compared to conventional buildings that are frequently over lit. Improvements in thermal comfort  are also a consistent findings from previous research . It is important to note that with the exception of reduced stale air, the significant improvements occurred predominantly only at Time  rather than Time . The Time  data collection point was in winter suggesting that this particular 'green' building's design features equalized indoor environmental quality across the year and the benefits were therefore most prevalent in this season. The improvement in reduced stale air is unsurprising given that the building design incorporates a large fresh air component and CO monitors. Electrostatic shocks were also significantly reduced in the 'green' building group both at Time  and Time . The perceptions of the physical environment were not always positive in the 'green' building. Notably the 'green' building group in the unmatched sample perceived the air to by significantly drier at Time  and unpleasant odours were more prevalent at Time  and Time .",
        "20": " .. \n\nThe  provide suggestive, but not conclusive, evidence that 'green' buildings may have positive wellbeing and effectiveness benefits for building occupants over conventional buildings. This result is more clearly seen in the matched sample . However, as suggested by Heerwagen and Zagreus  the  do not provide compelling support for claims by 'green' building councils that 'green' buildings are healthier and more productive. This should not be interpreted as a motivation to place less emphasis on indoor environmental quality in 'green' building designs. Instead, this should be seen as an incentive for further investigation to determine which elements of indoor environmental quality and 'green' building design have the best likelihood to positively influence occupant wellbeing and productivity. The reasons for the inconsistencies in  across studies  are probably due to methodological issues, the local climatic conditions , and to design differences between buildings. The methodological issues were covered more extensively in the earlier review of the liter-\nature where it was argued that most studies lack preoccupancy measures to determine change effectively and do not have relevant comparison groups to control for extraneous contextual variables. Hedge and Dorsey  also propose that many of the performance and wellbeing benefits are not realised in 'green' buildings because of a failure to address ergonomics concerns, such as eyestrain from computer workstations where the prevalence is comparable to conventional buildings.\n\nSecond, most 'green' buildings do not adopt all the design features that have been shown in the literature to independently promote wellbeing and effectiveness. 'Green' building designs involve a choice of design elements based on cost, the local climatic conditions, integration with other design elements such as geographical position and proximity to other buildings, and the preferences of the architects, engineers, developers, and occupants. Even if important 'green' building design features are incorporated into the building design this does not guarantee that they will be commissioned properly by facilities managers  or that building occupants will use the design features as intended . Certainly ergonomics is interested in the actual use of designs, not only on the designs themselves. As Attiainese  and Miller et al.  have suggested, ergonomics could play an important role in evaluating how 'green' buildings are used by their occupants. While a Building Users' Guide was developed for this 'green' building it is uncertain how many of the respondents had read  this guide. With regards to facilities managers, Lee and Kang  noted that the complexity of working with 'green' buildings was stumbling block. Facilities managers express uncertain and clearly require further training in how to operate 'green' buildings. Further, Kellert  refers to 'green' building specifications as being \"low environmental impact design\"  that may lead to reduced environmental impact but not necessarily to \"enhancing and restoring positive contact between people and nature  can foster human well-being and productivity\" . From this we suggest that 'green' building specifications require refinement  to focus on those qualities that lead to improved physical and psychological wellbeing and productivity gains.",
        "21": " .. \n\nDespite the more rigorous research design employed in this study there are still a number of limitations\nthat require noting. First, this study reports on a single 'green' building in one organization. Given different local climatic conditions, the specific architectural design, and organizational culture issues it may be difficult to generalize to other buildings in other organizations. Second, the sample size, especially in the matched group, was relatively small . Other studies have reported on  using similarly small numbers:  ,  . The matched sample consisted of only  respondents . While the study design is tight, the sample size is simply too small to make generalizations to the larger population. Future research should look to gather larger sample sizes so that more robust data analytical , such as repeated measures ANOVA, might be applied. The unmatched sample suffers from the limitation that each time point is essentially an independent sample. It is therefore difficult to establish confidence in comparisons between the time points. Third, as shown in the , it is often difficult to compare time points because of changing seasons. It is possible that different times of year may mask any real underlying differences  or that differences may be due to fluctuations in weather conditions . The most robust comparisons in this study are therefore Time  to Time  given the similar times of year. Finally, it is not certain how long it would take for building design components to filter through to impact on wellbeing and productivity. Sustainability Victoria  found several significant improvements only three months post-occupation, while Heerwagen  suggested that her analysis nine months later was probably not long enough. In this study data were collected six months and twelve months post-occupation. The largest number of significant differences were noted six months later, although this might have been due to the different seasons. It may be that a longer duration is required to detect significant differences in long-term effects such as productivity and wellbeing.\n\nThere is a great deal of scope for ergonomics to play a role in uncovering which aspects of 'green' building design have the greatest  impact on employee health, wellbeing, satisfaction, and productivity. The current research findings suggest that improved air quality, particularly fresh air and  monitors, is likely to have had the biggest impact. It\nis also suggested that it is not only the indoor environmental quality that plays a role in improved wellbeing and productivity but also the ergonomic design of interior spaces . Hedge  argued for the inclusion of the ergonomic design of office workspaces, the use of ergonomic guidelines for office equipment, and ergonomics training. Leaman  proposed that rapid responses to conditions , discomfort alleviation, reductions in technological complexity, appropriate occupation density were the key factors in ensuring employee wellbeing and productivity in buildings. Heerwagen and Hase  add to this list by suggest that designers should focus on biophilic design . There is a growing body of literature supporting the idea that the incorporation of nature into our built environment has positive wellbeing benefits  and  in higher productivity . This might involve designing buildings where windows give natural daylight and views to natural landscapes, gathering places outdoors, and the inclusion of nature inside buildings . Finally, the literature could benefit from more comprehensive investigations of the benefits of 'green' buildings that use a more controlled research design ."
