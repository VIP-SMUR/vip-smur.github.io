        "2": " \n\n This paper aims at analysing the impact of partial non-response in the association between urban environment and mental health in Brussels. The potential threats of the partial non-response are biases in survey estimates and statistics. The effect of non-response on statistical associations is often overlooked and evidence in the research literature is lacking.  Data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey  and  were used. The association between nonresponse and potential determinants was explored through logistic regressions.  Participants with low income, low educational levels, lower or higher age or in households with children were less likely to respond. When adjusting for socio-economic variables, non-response was higher in areas which are less vegetated, more polluted or more urbanised. Because the determinants of non-response and depressive disorders were similar, it is reasonable to assume that there will be more people with mental health problems among the non-respondents. And because more non-responses were found in low vegetation areas, the protective association between green spaces and mental health may be underestimated.\n\n\n Our capacity to measure the association between the urban environment and health is affected by non-response in surveys. The non-random spatial and socio-economic distribution of this bias affects the research findings.\nKeywords Mental Health, Non-response, Urban Environment, Brussels",
        "3": " \n\nThe issue of non-response and incomplete data, that often confronts population studies such as health surveys, is a well-known challenge in epidemiology  that has already been extensively studied . Non-response can occur at different stages of the survey and varies from the refusal to participate  to a nonresponse to one of the questions . While the determinants of initial non-response are difficult to study , partial non-response has the advantage that it can be studied on the basis of participants' partial responses .\nPersonal characteristics, such as economic status, are important in the variation of non-response . In the case of the Belgian Health Interview Survey , determinants of partial non-response have already been evaluated by Berete et al. : non-response is more frequent among youngsters, non-Belgians, low educational levels, lower income, residents of Brussels and Wallonia, and people with poor perceived health. Partial nonresponse is also strongly associated with the interviewer: it explains almost half  of the variability in partial non-response. Other studies  on partial nonresponse have additionally shown that non-response is greater for men and for unskilled workers. The potential threats of this partial non-response are biases in survey estimates and statistics. The effect of non-response on statistical associations is often overlooked and evidence in the research literature is lacking .\nUnderstanding the association between the urban environment and mental health is a challenging exercise. Cities are complex systems, with urban mental health outcomes affected by many interactions . This topic has been attracting a lot of interest and the literature has grown substantially over the past few years . A study conducted in Brussels concluded that exposure to traffic-related air pollution  was positively associated with higher odds of depressive disorders but no association between mental health and green surroundings, noise, or building morphology could be demonstrated . Concerning vegetation, these  differ from many studies that describe how higher levels of exposure to greenness can reduce levels of depressive symptoms . This raises the question of why there is no association in the case of Brussels.\nPersonal characteristics, such as economic status, are also important in mental health while the urban environment appears to be a less important determinant . Moreover, in Brussels, as in other cities, socio-spatial inequalities complicate matters: environmental factors are strongly correlated with socio-economic ones .\n\nIt is therefore difficult to disentangle the variance due to socio-economic status from the variance due to the urban environment.\nIf personal characteristics play an important role in explaining non-response and mental health status, we can question the magnitude of bias generated by nonresponse in the analysis of the association between urban environment and mental health. This paper therefore aims at analysing, characterising and discussing the impacts of non-responses in this association with the example of Brussels.",
        "5": " \nBrussels is the capital of Belgium, centrally located in the country. The city extends into three administrative regions: the Brussels-Capital Region , Flanders and Wallonia .We focus here on the urban area encompassed within the administrative border of the BrusselsCapital Region  because the Region was more intensively sampled compared to the rest of Belgium and because of data consistency issues for the urban environment indicators. The BCR is divided into  municipalities. It covers . kmÂ² and has . million inhabitants , which means an average density of  inhabitants per square kilometre.",
        "6": " \n\nThe study presented here consists of a secondary analysis of a population-based, cross-sectional study of the association between urban environment and mental health in Brussels, Belgium.  from the original research could not demonstrate any association between urban environment  and mental health except for traffic-related air pollution  exposure which was positively associated with higher odds of depressive disorders .",
        "7": " \n\nThe Belgian Health Interview Surveys  of  and  were used. We kept participants aged over   and living at the place of residence for at least one year .\nIn the BHIS, three types of non-response can be highlighted:  Initial non-response: refusal to participate in the survey , not addressed in this paper;  Selfadministered questionnaire  non-response: for those over  years of age, the survey consists in two parts: a face-to-face  interview and a SAQ, the latter of which is not filled out; and  Item non-response:\nat various points of the survey some questions were not answered by the participants. These last two types can be designated as partial non-response. Questions related to mental health are particularly sensitive. They are generally not asked in a FF interview to avoid desirability bias and are included in a SAQ, as is the case for the BHIS.",
        "8": " \n\nThe response to six indicators related to mental health was extracted from the BHIS : Energy level   , General Health Questionnaire   , Self-reported depression during the last year , Depressive disorder , Anxiety disorder  and Sleeping disorder   .\n\nNon-response to a mental health indicator means that there are not enough items answered to compute the indicator. The reason may be either that the SAQ was not completed or that some or all of the items related to an indicator were not answered. If at least % of the items related to an indicator have valid responses, the missing item are substituted by the mean value of the valid responses. For example, if  to  items out of the  items of the GHQ scale have missing values, the GHQ is still computed; whereas if more than  items are missing, the indicator score is considered missing .",
        "9": " \n\nThe urban environment was measured by eight indicators computed at the residence address of the BHIS participants. Urban greenness was assessed at three different geographical levels . At residence level, view of green was determined by the ratio of the total green area from Google Street View panorama  to the total area of the panorama. At street level, Linear tree density was defined as the ratio between the number of trees   and the street length and Street visible vegetation coverage is the vegetation coverage   on the street, and  m on either side. At neighbourhood level, Vegetation coverage was defined as the ratio of vegetation coverage  in a  m circle around the respondent's residence. The built-up environment was assessed by two indicators at the street level: the Street canyon effect which is the ratio between average building height and average open space width and the Street corridor effect which is the ratio between parallel facades length and street length. Noise was extracted from noise from multiple sources map  from Bruxelles Environnement for the years  and  at residence level. Black carbon exposition was defined as the annual average in the year of BHIS participation at residence level . See Pelgrims et al.  for more detailed descriptions of the indicators. These indicators were missing when the health survey could not be coupled with the participant's address . To address this, a 'no data' category was added to each indicator with missing value.",
        "10": " \n\nFive socio-economic indicators were used: Reported household income, Age, Gender, Family composition and Highest educational level in the household. These indicators were extracted from the BHIS. Non-responses were observed if the item has not been answered. To address this, a 'no answer' category was added to each indicator with non-responses.",
        "11": " \n\nThe frequency of non-response was summarised for each mental health and socio-economic indicator. Descriptive statistics were calculated to account for the sampling strategy. 'The weight for each sampled individual in the BHIS is the product of the reciprocal of the selection probability within a household and of a post stratification factor for each province according to age, gender, household size and quarter of the year in which the interview was done' .\n\nIn order to assess the association of socio-economic and urban environmental with non-response, logistic regressions with the non-response as dependent variable were computed: no missing data  vs. at least one nonresponse among six mental health indicators . Taking non-response to at least one mental health outcome as a proxy for non-response is a somewhat crude generalisation. However, it reflects a practice: if we want to analyse a complete case, i.e. take only those individuals who responded to all the questions we are interested in, we will then remove all individuals who did not respond to at least one question. Our purpose here was first to identify the characteristics of those excluded from the complete case by running models for socio-economic indicators. Secondly, we aimed at analysing whether these individuals were concentrated in specific environments by running single-exposure models for urban environment indicators  and adjusted models  for urban environment indicators .\n\nIn order to assess the differences and similarities between the socio-economic characteristics of nonrespondents and participants with depressive disorders, two groups of logistic regressions were performed for socio-economic variables:  with depressive disorders\n\n\n\n\nas dependent variable  and  with the nonresponse to depressive disorders related questions as dependent variable .\n\nCorrect estimates and valid inferences of odds ratio  were obtained by taking into account the survey weights, strata and clusters relative to the sample design. All analyses were performed using the statistical software R  using the survey package .",

        "14": " \n\nFigure  shows the association between socio-economic variables and non-responses through univariate models and fully adjusted model. These models are also displayed in Additional File . Considering that the coefficients between the univariate models and the fully adjusted model are very similar, only the coefficients of the univariate models will be discussed below. Participants in the lower socio-economic quartiles  were less likely to respond than those in the higher quartile  ( \n\n\n whole study population;  participants with SAQ available\n and  . respectively). Compared to , older  and younger  participants were less likely to respond . Compared to single participants, couples with child  and one parent with child  were less likely to respond . Finally, participants from households with a lower educational level  were less likely to respond than those with a higher education  and the effect size increases as the level of education decrease .\n\nFigure  shows the association between urban environment indicators and non-response through univariate models  and adjusted models  for gender, age, reported household income and year of the BHIS. These models are also displayed in Additional File . When adjusted for socio-economic variables,\nnon-response was higher in areas with lower amounts of vegetation cover , lower in less polluted areas  and in less urbanised areas .",
        "15": " Comparison of partial non-response determinant and depressive disorders determinants\n\nFigure  shows the associations between socio-economic variables and non-response to depressive disorders related questions  and the associations between socio-economic variables and depressive disorders . These models are also displayed in Additional File  and . It should be noted that the two populations studied are different: population of models D and F is limited to the respondents to depressive disorders related questions only. The comparison of the two types of models nevertheless allows us to have\n\nan overview of the similarities and differences even if it cannot be compared on a more formal basis. The determinants of non-response are quite similar to the determinants of depressive disorders. Odds ratios are similar for household income, age  and education level, while there are substantial differences for family composition and gender.",
        "16": "\n\nOur  confirm that personal characteristics play a major role in explaining both non-response and mental health status. The socio-economic variables associated with non-response found in this paper  are similar to those found in the literature: non-response is more frequent among young , low educated  and low income  inhabitants. Family composition or type of household is not a common studied factor in\nthe literature; Ekholm et al.  and Jaehn et al.  found that married people are more likely to respond to the survey than unmarried people but it is difficult to link this finding to our  because marital status has not been taken into account as such and being in a couple is mixed with having children. A higher non-response rate for men than for women is often found in the literature  but was not found in our study.\nBased on the comparison between the personal characteristics associated with non-response and depressive disorders in the  , it is reasonable to assume that there will be more people with mental health problems within the group of non-respondents compared to the group of respondents. This is coherent with the literature that examined poor subjective health , chronic condition  or long-term health condition  as a determinant for non-response.\n\n\nWith these , we can extrapolate the effect of non-response to the association between mental health and the urban environment. Considering the association between vegetation and mental health, several studies on the topic have shown that vegetation is a protective factor for mental health . However, in a previous study using the same data as this paper , no association was found. With our , it can be assumed that there would be proportionally higher number of respondents with mental disorders and low vegetation cover  than actually observed due to non-responses  because both low vegetation cover and mental health problems are associated with a higher probability for non-responses. Indeed,  show that the personal characteristics associated with mental health have strong similarities with those of non-response and significantly more non-responses are found in places with lower vegetation cover.\nConsidering the equation of an odds ratio  with  as the number of respondents with mental disorder BCDA, i.e. the odds ratio observed is smaller than the true odds ratio.\n\nDespite the strength of the arguments presented and the valuable insights gained from this study, we have to acknowledge missing data cannot be recovered. Without complete data on all individuals, it is challenging to ascertain associations and their implications accurately. Future prospective studies can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between personal characteristics, non-response, mental health, and the urban environment.",
        "17": " \n\nIn , we here show that the risk of low green space cover  is underestimated using the BHIS data. Indeed, the capacity to measure the association between urban environment and health is affected by non-response in surveys. The non-random spatial and socio-economic distribution of this bias affects the parameter estimates in the statistical models. In a sense, non-responses may be seen as a cause of a loss of statistical power, leading to a lower probability to statistically detect differences if such differences would exist. This may explain why when studying environment and human health,  are sometimes inconclusive or inconsistent with the literature. The environment and human health association is particularly challenging to study as we are dealing with multifactorial elements. More attention should be given to understand the biases that can be encountered due to\nnon-responses and to the non-random character of this bias. A combination of  or a mixed-method approach  can help to obtain a comprehensive understanding of these highly complex topics."
