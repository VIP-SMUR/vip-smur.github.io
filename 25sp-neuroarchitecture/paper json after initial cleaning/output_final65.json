Although these aspects have been investigated in separate streams of research, stress, autonomic reactivity and circadian misalignment can be hypothesized to play a prominent role in the causal pathways underlining the complex relationship between the urban environment and these two health dimensions. This study aims at quantifying the momentary impact of environmental stressors on increased autonomic reactivity and circadian rhythm, and thereby on mood and anxiety symptoms and sleep quality in the context of everyday urban living.\nMethod: The present article reports the protocol for a feasibility study that aims at assessing the daily environmental and mobility exposures of  participants from the urban area of Jerusalem over  days. Every participant will carry a set of wearable sensors while being tracked through space and time with GPS receivers. Skin conductance and heart rate variability will be tracked to monitor participants' stress responses and autonomic reactivity, whereas electroencephalographic signal will be used for sleep quality tracking. Light exposure, actigraphy and skin temperature will be used for ambulatory circadian monitoring. Geographically explicit ecological momentary assessment  will be used to assess participants' perception of the environment, mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep quality and vitality. For each outcome variable , hierarchical mixed models including random effects at the individual level will be used. In a separate analysis, to control for potential unobserved individual-level confounders, a fixed effect at the individual level will be specified for case-crossover analyses .\n: Recent developments in wearable sensing , as employed in our study or with even more advanced  reviewed in the, make it possible to gather information on the functioning of neuro-endocrine and circadian systems in a real-world context as a way to investigate the complex interactions between environmental exposures, behavior and health. Our work aims to provide evidence on the health effects of urban stressors and circadian disruptors to inspire potential interventions, municipal policies and urban planning schemes aimed at addressing those factors.\n\nKEYWORDS\nenvironmental stress, circadian rhythm, sleep, mental health, wearable sensors",
        "5": "  and rationale\n\nBy  more than  of the world population will be living in urbanized areas . This fast-surging trend will significantly change the environment and expose larger parts of the global population to the health hazards that proliferate in highly urbanized areas, with serious consequences for public health  but also to the health opportunities in these environments. Physical factors widely distributed in the urban environment, such as nocturnal light, air and noise pollution, increased heat and more generally the lower presence of green and blue areas, have been associated by several studies with higher prevalence of mood and anxiety symptoms and with worse sleep conditions . Social science studies have focused instead on the individuals' experience and perception of social cohesion, safety and risk of violence within their neighborhood and found associations with symptoms of mental disorder and worse sleep outcomes . Moreover, these urban risk unequally distributed across neighborhoods seem to exercise a differential impact on different strata of the population, with ethnic minorities and low socioeconomic status groups experiencing the greatest effect . Disparities in mental health and sleep outcomes seem to follow a comparable pattern of geographical distribution than the different socioeconomic groups within cities across affluent and disadvantaged areas. In other words, the specific distribution of environmental stressors within the city could contribute to explain, in addition to socioeconomic stressors themselves, the mental and sleep health disparities observed between neighborhoods, and could play active role in the preservation of such inequality . Converging evidence suggests that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods or neighborhoods with environmental stressors is associated with a range of poor health outcomes, from cardiometabolic conditions to mental and sleep disorders, which might surge in comorbidity with each other reinforcing and maintaining unhealthy status and maladaptive behaviors . While cardiovascular urban risk has been inquired extensively , there is still a lot of progress to be reached in the investigation of the environmental determinants of mental and more particularly sleep disorders. These two health dimensions have often been investigated separately, thus overlooking the large synergic interactions that inevitably arise between the symptoms of these different problems . Not only mental and sleep disorders might reinforce each other in their symptomatic expression and health complications, but they also appear to share similar environmental and behavioral determinants . One of the reasons may be that the urban environment can affect common health physiological systems shared by the two health dimensions through similar causal mechanisms.\n\nStress, in particular, has been hypothesized to play a prominent role in the potential causal pathways underlining the complex relationship between the urban environment and health . Living in urban environments, and particularly in specific neighborhoods , is associated with repeated exposures to environmental stress (e.g., pollution,\nnoise, social stress etc.), which can burden over time the individual health physiological function by affecting the neuroendocrineimmune axis. Specifically, cumulative loads of stress can lead to maladaptive alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and neuroendocrine dysregulation observed in mental and sleep disorders . In parallel, chronic stress can also lead to enhanced autonomic reactivity in the form of heightened sympathetic reactivity and withdrawal of parasympathetic activity . Such autonomic imbalance contributes to the process of stress sensitization that is often associated with psychopathology  and sleep disruption . In light of these intuitions, the present study will investigate the environmental determinants of stress and their consequent influence on autonomic reactivity, and through it on mental health and sleep quality.\n\nCity dwellers experience less sunlight and are exposed to a much greater extent to those environmental circadian disruptors that are overly present in urbanized areas . There is large evidence that those living in highly illuminated areas at night, mostly in densely populated cities, tend to experience later sleep onset, reduced melatonin secretion and are more likely to develop sleep problems . In our contemporary age, the circadian rhythm is threatened furthermore by the ubiquitous presence of digital devices. It has been proven that exposure to the blue light emitted by digital screens  induces night-time alertness and inhibits melatonin secretion , resulting in circadian misalignment by shifting the timing of sleep . These findings highlight the need to investigate individual light exposure both outdoor and indoor while tracking at the same time the individual usage of blue light emitting devices.\n\nCircadian rhythm disruption  is not only associated with sleep alterations  but appears to be a common underlying factor across most mental health disorders. This is due to the detrimental consequences of the associated sleep loss and the dysregulation of the neurobiological systems involved in the regulation of emotions and stress that are subject to circadian control . The correlational nature of these findings stresses the need for developing a methodological and data collection framework that could track these different health dimensions and would permit to take a step forward in investigating the directionality of the relationships between sleep, circadian rhythm and mental health.\n\nThe evidence on the neighborhood-related risk provided by the scientific literature is mostly based on population studies that do not rely on a continuous monitoring of the environmental exposures across space and time. Most studies assessed personal exposures solely at the residential neighborhood level, whereas city-dwellers spend large parts of their daily time outside of their residential area . The present project aims at overcoming such restricted focus on residential neighborhoods by adopting a continuous monitoring framework for assessing environmental exposures without misclassifying personal exposures. To do so, on the grounds of previous work  the chosen methodology relies on Global Positioning System  receivers to geographically follow and contextualize participants' exposures over their daily mobility. GPS tracking will be adopted in combination with questionnaires delivered via smartphone to test\nparticipants' subjective perception through geographically explicit ecological momentary assessment  . In addition, a set of wearable sensors will be carried by participants to achieve realtime ambulatory monitoring of psychophysiological parameters as a way to dynamically follow their responses to their daily environments. This innovative method will make it possible to analyze the spatiotemporal context and the causal effects of momentary objective exposures to selected environmental factors. In , the cutting-edge essence of the present work pertains to the high spatiotemporal resolution of its environmental exposure assessments and to the broad range of intermediate physiological processes and health outcomes included for the first time in one single study.\n\nUnderstanding the intricate relationship between urban living and mental health, sleep quality, and overall wellbeing is of paramount importance in today's rapidly urbanizing world. As urban populations continue to grow, the impact of the urban environment on individuals' health cannot be underestimated. Previous research has highlighted the association between living in urban areas and the increased likelihood of experiencing mental health issues and sleep disturbances. However, to develop effective interventions and policies aimed at improving the health and wellbeing of city dwellers, we need a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study seeks to fill crucial gaps in the current body of knowledge by employing innovative ecological  and wearable sensor technology to assess the real-world impact of environmental stressors and circadian disruptors on individuals' mental health and sleep quality. By investigating these interrelated factors at a high spatio-temporal resolution, we aim to uncover the specific environmental mechanisms that contribute to the complex web of urban health challenges. Ultimately, this research will not only enhance our understanding of urban health but also provide actionable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and healthcare professionals to develop strategies that promote healthier urban living environments and improve the quality of life for millions of city residents worldwide.\n\nAs we delve into the complex relationship between urban living, mental health, and sleep quality, our study endeavors to apply the exposome framework to explore the intricate interplay between environmental stressors, circadian disruptors, and various health outcomes. The exposome refers to the entirety of environmental exposures individuals encounter throughout their lives, including factors such as pollutants, behavior and psychosocial stressors that collectively influence health and contribute to the development of diseases over time . In this context, the urban exposome is conceptualized as the continuous spatiotemporal monitoring of quantitative and qualitative indicators associated with the various urban domains that shape the quality of life and the health of urban populations .\n\nTo incorporate the concept of exposome and encompass its multidimensional facets, this study adopts an innovative approach that goes beyond traditional population-based assessments. The sensor-based and GEMA  leveraged in this study allow us to observe the spatiotemporal and behavioral components of urban health exposome with high-resolution data granularity and ecological validity. In , by combining the continuous\nmonitoring of environmental exposures, individual behaviors, and physiological responses, our research strives to capture a portion of the exposome, to shed light on the intricate interplay between urban living, mental health, and sleep quality.",

The protocol allows monitoring the daily fluctuations of sleep and mental health outcomes to better understand the reciprocal influence that these two health dimensions may exert on each other. In addition, the timing of environmental exposures and health outcomes will be biologically contextualized by tracking participants' circadian rhythm and entrainment to light . Our study combines mobile sensing   for an accurate assessment of momentary changes in health outcomes in the urban environment. Our setup  aims to track participants during their daily urban activities and disaggregate their exposures, behavior and health outcomes over space and time while accounting for all possible confounders . The ultimate goal of such an approach is to go beyond the mere description of correlational associations and unveil the specific environmental mechanisms that cause momentary changes in sleep and mental health. Overall, our protocol will provide evidence on the health effects of urban stressors and circadian disruptors to inspire potential interventions, municipal policies and urban planning schemes that may be able to mitigate and contain them.",

Individuals working at night  or without a fixed home will be considered ineligible for the study. Multiple steps in the recruitment process and a detailed set of screening criteria will be used to filter out ineligible candidates and to ensure diversity within the sample.\n\nGeofencing technology will be adopted to target participants from specific geographical areas of interest within selected administrative units. The small sample of this study cannot be considered \"representative\" of a large population of almost one million people such as in Jerusalem city. For this reason, quota sampling is an appropriate method because it aims at ensuring that the diversity of different population groups is well-represented\nin the sample. Thus, non-probability quota sampling will be used to recruit the participants and allocate them into several equal distinct strata. The principle of quota sampling is that when the desired number of people in a given category is reached, the recruiting of other participants in such category is stopped. Quota sampling in this study will be non-proportional because the distribution of participants between the categories of the sample will not necessarily correspond to the distribution in the population. The quota sample will be stratified according to population density, neighborhood average household income, age, and gender.",

During the day participants wear the sensor on the neck collar of their clothes through a safety pin to get as close as possible to the eye level. In the context of this study, light exposure is more accurately measured at the eye level compared to other parts of the body  as it reflects more precisely the transmission of light from the eye retina to the suprachiasmatic nucleus which is the central circadian peacemaker . Lux intensity  and time of exposure will be used to classify participants' state of entrainment to sunlight. Following previous protocols, to compensate for the lack of light spectrum detection with the chosen device, measurements over  Lux will be considered as sun exposure whereas lower lux counts will be classified as artificial light .

To mitigate these concerns, we will continuously monitor data collection instruments to promptly\naddress any technical issues and employ strategies such as reminders to optimize participants' engagement and minimize attrition. Recognizing the importance of participants' cooperation in this demanding study, we will provide substantial motivational support. Leveraging our prior experience with sensor-based data collection, we will offer robust assistance, including check-in calls during data collection to ensure both proper tool functioning and adherence to instructions. Furthermore, we will establish a dedicated support hotline, available around the clock, including evenings and weekends, to promptly address any participant's inquiries. This comprehensive support structure not only enhances the overall study experience but also serves as an effective means to overcome potential challenges tied to data collection and participants' commitment.\n\nSecondly, our statistical models will account for individuallevel confounders and temporal autocorrelation, employing robust statistical techniques and sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of findings. These models will also take into account potential timevarying confounders. For example, the analysis of relationships between objective urban stressors and mood and anxiety is susceptible to reverse causality bias, as individuals may report heightened negative environmental stressors due to their previous mental health symptoms, hindering the assessment of causal relationships. To mitigate this bias, we plan to incorporate a variable that considers prior momentary mental health state to account for potential reverse causality effects in our analyses. By implementing these strategies and addressing potential biases and challenges proactively, we aim to enhance the validity and reliability of our study's findings.",
