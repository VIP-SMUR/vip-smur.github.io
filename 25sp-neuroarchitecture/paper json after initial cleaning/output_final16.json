        "9": " \n\nIn an effort to arrest the spread of coronavirus  infection, a nationwide lockdown was declared in India in March . To assess how personal built environments affected the citizens in the first few weeks, an explorative online survey was conducted, eliciting responses about work habits before the lockdown, psychological wellbeing, time spent in various activities, characteristics of those who worked from home, and food and sleep patterns. We received   responses with an average age of . years . The major difference caused by the lockdown was a reduction in the time taken and distance travelled of the commute to workplaces, which was an average of  minutes and . km , respectively. In terms of diet, subjects who were vegetarian did not experience any difference, unlike those who were non-vegetarians . The  show an association of the dependent variable of 'feeling in general' with predictor variables of 'energy, pep, vitality' and 'feel healthy to work' during the pandemic, whereas the predictor variables of 'energy, pep, vitality', 'happy and satisfied personal life', 'feel healthy to work' show an association with the dependent variable of 'feeling in general' before the lockdown with a significance of  and  and , respectively. Among those who worked from home in constrained environments, people found spaces and seemed to adapt reasonably well to the built environment with employees showing a preference for working from bedrooms and students for working from 'sit-out'  spaces . There was no change in the quality or quantity of sleep during the lockdown. This study in the early weeks of the lockdown documents the way in which individuals lived through it in terms of the built environment at home.\n\n work from home, diet, sleep, stress, entertainment, television viewing, built environment",
        "10": "  \n\nThe coronavirus  epidemic, identified at the beginning of  has the ability to spread by droplet transmission. In the initial phase of the pandemic, when the study was carried out, the only measures to reduce the transmission of the virus consisted of physical distancing, frequent washing of hands with soap and water, and avoiding touching one's face. These are still the core preventive measures even after vaccines and potential medicines became available to treat the infection.\n\nAlthough the physical measures are simple to itemise, they are difficult to implement. In an attempt to prevent the community spread of infection, India imposed a lockdown, beginning on  March . Depending on the situation, the lockdown has been modified over time.\n\nAlthough the lockdown was for the common good, the uncertainty about the disease coupled with nationwide lockdown led to a stressful situation. It is understandable that apprehension and anxiety could result from loneliness due to social isolation, a fear of being infected, the resultant economic impact and uncertainty about the future course . A report that compared psychological distress and loneliness in  and in April  showed that the prevalence of serious psychological distress increased three-fold in April  .\n\nFollowing the outbreak of COVID-, a number of studies were published on knowledge, attitude and practices  about the conditions across the globe, including different parts of India .\n\nThe built environment refers to 'environments that are modified by humans, including homes, schools, workplaces, highways, urban sprawl, accessibility to amenities, leisure and pollution' . It is conceivable that the response to the pandemic and measures to slow its spread can be modified by the built environment. To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any studies evaluating the effect of the built environment on daily living and psychological stress during the lockdown. A report from Brazil studied the spatial correlation between the incidence of COVID- and human development . Doshi et al. reported that fear about COVID- was low due to a lack of knowledge, although being a woman, having a lower educational status and being a health care worker were associated with higher fear levels . In situations such as these, in-person interviews are neither feasible nor desirable. Earlier studies have shown that social media platforms can be employed to recruit as well as to communicate about COVID in both developed and developing countries . Therefore, we conducted an online survey to assess the effect on living habits, attitudes, and other aspects influenced by the built environment during the early weeks of the lockdown.\n\nThe twin aims of the study were to evaluate how activities of daily living  have had a bearing on wellbeing during the lockdown and how spaces at home have supported ADL during the 'stay home stay safe' strategy. The research questions we attempt to address are:  Is there a perceptual change in wellbeing during lockdown to that of before lockdown?  As a health concern, are there any changes in food habits and rest/sleep?  How do people accomplish their responsibilities of work/study?",
        "11": " \n\nThe second phase of lockdown, which began on  April  and lasted until  May , had stringent restrictions of the instruction to 'stay home', with - hours of relaxed restrictions in the morning to enable citizens to acquire essential commodities. A structured questionnaire was developed covering different sections in sequence, namely demographics, food intake, ADL, the built environment , leisure and entertainment, and health and wellbeing.\n\nThis self-reported questionnaire survey designed in Google forms  was administered online from  April  to  May , that is, during and four days beyond the end of the second phase of lockdown . The online questionnaire was circulated to the contacts of the authors using online social media.\n\nThe section on Demographics has data pertaining to Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Marital Status, Education and Employment. The Food Intake section is related to information on changes of intake of food during principal meals and any change in intake of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food items. Information on ADL covered day-to-day tasks. Questions in the Built Environment\nFigure \nDuration of online survey.\nsection related to where their residence is located , type of house , what spaces does a respondent have, and where they spent most of their time during lockdown. As watching television  and spending time with family at home were common leisure and entertainment activities, questions were included on the preferences on which TV channels were watched, such as movies, sports, education, spiritual, serials/drama, music, environment and news. Lastly, the section on Health and Wellbeing relate to whether they were taking any medication along with six questions on wellbeing . Following the objectives of the study, the wellbeing of the subjects were assessed for ADL and how spaces at home supported them using a linear regression.",
        "12": " \n\nOf the  responses received, there was a considerable demographic representation of age, gender, food habits and profession . For a mean age of . years  the mean body mass index , a physiological parameter was . .\n\nThe study was conducted in the Andhra Pradesh region of India which constitutes .\\ of the COVID- confirmed cases of the total confirmed cases in the country. The population of the state of Andhra Pradesh is  million constituting  of the  million population of India. The state ranks second in the total number of confirmed cases of COVID- in India . With the prevailing limitations for conducting a physical survey and limited access to online survey  due to India being a developing country, there were  respondents with a composition of mean age of . years ,  were male and  were female,  were work related and  were home-based and  were non-vegetarians and  were vegetarians. Work related means the major activities or the profession of an individual involves them being away from home and includes employment and education. The margin of error is  for the sample size and the population of the study with a  confidence interval  and thus the  differ within  percentage points from the real population value  of the time. Linear or multiple regression analysis was employed to evaluate the relationship of the dependent variables with predictor variables. Independent variables which have significance of  with coefficients that represent an association with the dependent variables are discussed. Smaller values of  may not necessarily be insignificant, although caution must be exercised in interpretation without being combined with other statistical . However, based on the knowledge of the subject area in studies of human behaviour, which are difficult to predict, a high value of  has been described as being 'almost impossible' . Given this caveat, the  at least show a trend that can be further studied. The variables considered throw light on aspects that could be taken into account to find ways to live with situations like the COVID- pandemic. Statistical analysis using Excel was\n\n\ncarried out for the parameters of demographics, food intake, ADL, the built environment, leisure and entertainment, and health and wellbeing.",
        "14": " \n\nQuestions on whether there was any change in food intake in main courses, viz. breakfast, lunch, evening snacks and dinner were considered. The respondents were asked whether there had been any increase or decrease of food intake or if food intake had remained the same during and before the lockdown. Also information was taken on what type and quantity of vegetarian and nonvegetarian food was consumed.\n\nThe cumulative quantity in terms of 'increase', 'decrease' or 'remained the same' for various food items in vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups was divided into a number of items for the respective groups to normalise. Items such as chicken, mutton, fish, etc. were considered for non-vegetarians and various types of leafy vegetables, tubers, vegetables, etc. were considered for vegetarians. Figure  shows the main course and type and quantity of food items by these respective groups and this should ideally be the same value. The t-test for vegetarian and nonvegetarian groups show significant differences  for food intake during the lockdown. Furthermore, the standard error of mean for the two groups of vegetarian and non-vegetarian food intake during lockdown shows a reduction in intake of non-vegetarian items .",
        "15": " \n\nSelf-reported questions on perception of wellbeing parameters include 'energy, pep, vitality', 'happy and satisfied personal life', 'feel healthy to work', 'generally tense' and 'worried about health'. However, a question on 'feeling in general' was asked which included overall perception of health. A regression analysis of different predictor wellbeing parameters that contribute to 'feeling in general' was analysed for both before and during lockdown. The  of  subjects show an association of the dependent variable of 'feeling in general' with a significance of ,  to predictor variables of 'energy, pep, vitality' and 'feel healthy to work' with a positive coefficient of . and . , respectively, during the pandemic situation.\n\nWhereas the predictor variables of 'energy, pep, vitality', 'happy and satisfied personal life', 'feel healthy to work' show significant relation, , with the dependent variable of 'feeling in general' observed before lockdown with , indicating a greater reliability with positive coefficients of predictor variables of , respectively. It is expected that 'energy, pep or vitality', 'happy and satisfied personal life' and 'feel healthy to work' are associated with 'feeling in general' before the lockdown in the absence or nonexistence of the disease. With the emergence of the epidemic and the promulgation of stay at home measures the association of 'feeling in general' is maintained in 'energy, pep or vitality' and 'feel healthy to work', albeit, with a mean change in coefficients of the predictor variables. While there was reduction in coefficient of 'energy, pep or vitality' compared with feelings before lockdown, the increase in the coefficient for 'feel healthy to work' during lockdown could be attributed to improved safe conditions of work from home . It is also strengthened by the fact that an association of a 'happy and satisfied personal life' with 'feeling in general' was noticed before lockdown .\n\nFigure \nFood intake during lockdown.\n\n\n*Indicates significance at .\nCI, confidence interval; WfH, work from home.",

        "18": " \n\nThe average distance of . km and an average -minute travel time by respondents to an office/educational institute saved them time and energy during lockdown that could instead be contributed to WfH . We assessed the relationship to home with WfH in two different aspects. One being the ownership of the house  and the other was the typology of the building . Group housing is a type of housing consisting of four to  tenements in a building whereas an apartment block has more than  tenements in a building. In the  samples surveyed, there are three categories of ownership of which  of them owned their own residence,  lived in rented houses and  lived in quarters provided by the employer. As regards the typology of building,  were apartment/group housing,  were individual/ independent houses and  were row housing. However, quarters provided by the employer in ownership category and row housing in typology of the building were not considered due to small sample size. Also there were  home-based  that were not considered.\n\nThe generally available spaces in residential buildings in India are a kitchen, a living room, a dining room, a balcony or sit-out space, and a toilet/washroom. More than  of residential buildings have between one and four bedrooms . Spaces such as living and dining rooms are noisy. Often, living and dining spaces where multiple activities take place are interconnected in India. Relatively quieter spaces such as the balcony/sit-out spaces are mostly used as micro-gardens and for relaxation for short durations, while the quietest area is the bedroom. It is important to find a suitable place to work at home. The number of dwellings studied consisting of these spaces are shown in the figure  with few having exclusive spaces viz. storage space, home theatre, garage/parking, terrace and back/front yard .\n\nWe assessed the response of the participants on WfH and found that people whose homes are of the group housing/apartment type that constitute  of those surveyed have no significant relation, which seemingly reflects unfavourable conditions. As mentioned earlier, group housing is a type of housing consisting of four to  tenements in a building whereas an apartment block has more than  tenements in a building.\n\nThose staying in individual houses  irrespective of the ownership prefer to WfH from their bedroom space  with  and a positive . coefficient . As for the students, those who stay in their own houses  prefer balconies/sit-out spaces when performing their work  with a positive coefficient of . with the dependent variable WfH. Interestingly, for the students the association of the toilet/washing area with WfH  and -. coefficient although negative, reflects its importance during work time. It is likely that toilet/washing areas in institutes are used by a greater number of people, specifically in India and during COVID- this will be a concern for students. And it is reasonable to anticipate that the availability of a toilet/washing area is negatively associated with WfH compared to that available at institutes. Moreover, there is a concern for the hygiene required during COVID- for toilets/washing areas at institutes compared with those at home.\n\nFigure \nSpaces in dwellings.\nFigure \nPercentage of the number of bedrooms and balcony/sit-out spaces present in dwellings.\n\nTherefore, the general living conditions in Indian homes can broadly be categorised into active and passive zones. Activities related to watching TV, family interactions and daily household chores are performed in the active zones that include the living room, dining room and kitchen and these are often noisy. Hence, with no other choice left, the possibility of WfH most likely happens in bedrooms and sit-out spaces that are relatively calm and are sufficient in number considering the average size of four members in a family . However, the design of spaces that could accommodate the requirements of formal and calm environments for WfH is important during situations of 'stay home stay safe'.",
        "19": "\n\nWe report an exploratory review of how the built environment was impacted by the world's biggest lockdown following the COVID- pandemic; rather than taking a narrow technical view of architecture per se in terms of construction, transmissibility and other micro-environmental factors, we considered the different ways in which people responded to working from home in their immediate built environment.\n\nThe average distance of . km and average -minute travel time of the respondents to the office/ educational institute have actually saved them time and energy that could be contributed to WfH. Essentially, we observed that the major difference entailed by the lockdown was a reduction of time and travel to go to their workplace. In terms of food intake, those who ate only vegetarian food did not experience any change, unlike those who were non-vegetarians, who reduced their intake of meat. This was necessitated both by the cost as well as an  fear of transmission of infection through meat. There is a fear amongst people that wet marketplaces are a potential threat of transmission of diseases such as COVID-; as such there is a need for a transformational change in the way they function. Those involved in creating the built environment could rethink strategies for the location and design of wet marketplaces to enhance how they function and offer safe and healthy places for people to live.\n\nWatching TV at home was a common pastime to fill the time available during the lockdown. Forced social isolation did not alter the channels watched . Watching the general news and COVID- updates seems to have positive affects along with watching channels devoted to spirituality. However, there is a need to consider how the design of homes, building construction and materials could support multiple activities in the home and help with WfH. Acoustics and the Internet of Things amongst others could become integral design considerations for those involved in designing the built environment.\n\nThe unprecedented lockdown led to families staying at home, and accomplishing all their usual activities in an environment for which it was not originally designed, viz. employment work, studies, entertainment and leisure all at once by all the family members. Among those who worked from home, most preferred to work from their bedroom. Students preferred to study outside the house, on balconies or in sit-outs.\n\nSleep is often compromised in the modern world, where people are accused of 'gorging themselves with food and starving themselves of sleep' . The pandemic was a situation where there was ample time available for sleep/rest, without the distractions of work or the forced circadian\ndisruptions of shift work. However there does not seem to have been any adverse effect, but the small sample sizes make it difficult to reach valid s. However, factors including fear of being infected and economic uncertainty could have played a major role. It was a period of forced isolation, not a volitional vacation; in addition the period of study could have been too short for any changes to be perceived.\n\nFollowing the recognition of the COVID- pandemic, attention has focused on built environment trends to lower the risk of transmission in the design of buildings , as well as other tactile surfaces such as doorknobs, switches, toilet handles and faucet knobs . More broad-based concerns about the construction of smart cities which can deal with future pandemics consisted of the popularisation of health science, improving emergency health systems and continuing multi-industry coordination mechanisms, to deal with pandemics .\n\nThe concept and application of the built environment owes its origin to epidemics and pandemics in the past: bubonic plague in the th century, yellow fever in the th century, and cholera and smallpox in the th century all resulted in innovations such as broad boulevards, sewer systems, plumbing and urban sprawl .\n\nBesides healthy workplaces, telecommuting and online accessibility of various services including telemedicine, distance learning, online shopping and online entertainment are bound to evolve. Houses are not just physical structures, they are part of a broader social sphere; pandemics disturb the structures and routines that are closely inter-related, which is an interesting macro feature to consider . Some of the potential ways COVID- will impact the built environment consist of a shift away from large city offices, a reduced reliance on cars for transport to jobs and the development of new forms of public spaces .\n\nUltimately these must lead to a rethinking of design, operations, behaviour and maintenance to ensure that first the workplace and thereafter the economy are less susceptible to disruptions caused by disease .\n\nTo convert the crisis into an opportunity, one must plan to respond to such unexpected events by recalibrating transport facilities, improving spatial distancing in workplaces, as well as redesigning the environment by fusing blue and green infrastructures .",

The 'stay home stay safe' strategy contributed to wellbeing factors of general health, happiness and vitality while alleviating feelings of worry about health and feeling tense.\n\nThere seems to have been some influence of 'energy, pep or vitality' and 'feel healthy to work'. The coefficient, 'energy, pep or vitality' seems to have had an increased effect before the lockdown when compared to during the lockdown and for 'feel healthy to work' it seems to have improved during lockdown as a result of being in a safe WfH situation.\n\nHowever, the predictor variable of 'happy, satisfied personal life' was prevalent before the lockdown.\n\nIn terms of food intake, those who ate only vegetarian food did not experience any change, unlike those who were non-vegetarians, who reduced their intake of meat. This was necessitated both by the cost as well as an  fear of transmission through meat.

The professionals of the built environment could rethink strategies for the location and design of wet marketplaces to enhance the way they function and offer safe and healthy places. With ample time to rest there does not seem to have been any effect on sleep prior to the lockdown, that is, during normal days and during lockdown.\n\nThe average distance of . km and -minute time travel to the office/educational institute have actually saved time and energy to contribute to WfH.

        "21": " \n\nOur exploratory study has limitations in having a small sample of subjects along with inherent biases in the recruitment of subjects who had access to the internet, were conversant in English and agreed to participate in the study. The method of the online questionnaire circulated to the contacts of the authors on social media was adopted from studies under similar situations . Nevertheless, it confirms the principles the built environment have on wellbeing and health  and hopefully provides an impetus for developments based on sound biopsychosocial concepts."
