        "3": " \n\nThere is a degree of ambiguity about the specific factors of the built environment that impact people's mental health. This paper aims to examine the relations between an individual's mental health and the environmental risk factors. Drawing on clinical data and an outpatient survey from a hospital in China,  samples over  years old were available. A Boruta algorithm is deployed to determine the factors that affect people's mental health and an association rule algorithm is then introduced to ascertain the associations between risk factors. The analysis reveals the main risk environmental factors  and their coupling effects on mental health. Environmental degradation may be a key mediator in the green space-mental health relationship. Another key risk pattern is that physically unhealthy people who reside in places lacking green spaces are prone to having mental health problems. Considering the identified risks, there is a need for built environment professionals  to place greater emphasis on incorporating green spaces and environment management strategies into housing developments. This paper will contribute to the development of urban planning and management policies to create environments that support people's positive mental health.",
        "4": " . \n\nPeople spend their daily lives within the built environment . Research has shown that the built environment can affect people's physical health . It is only within the last decade, however, that the significant role that the built environment can have on people's mental health  has begun to be realized . With the increasing need to create sustainable and liveable cities, it is urgent to formulate urban planning and management policies to create environments that support people's positive mental health.\n\nResearch has repeatedly demonstrated, for example, that the quality of housing , landscape environment (e.g.,\ngreen spaces), and community service facilities are key determinants influencing mental health . The design of a house's lighting layout can contribute to depression . In addition, uncomfortable visuals, such as poor pavement conditions, graffiti, vandalism, and litter, can impact the levels of stress and contribute to feelings of insecurity .\n\nDespite the increasing amount of understanding and knowledge about the determinants of the built environment influencing a person's mental health, a degree of ambiguity surrounds their primary causal influences . An individual's mental disorder is a multifactorial disease and therefore researchers need to combine factors to explain its presence and the adverse conditions that result in its existence . By contrast, there has been a tendency for existing studies to focus on the impact of specific factors on mental health, such as green spaces, air pollution and traffic noise . The key risk factors of the built environment affecting people's mental health and the relationship between them need to be further explored.\n\nThe research presented in this paper draws on the clinical diagnosis and questionnaire survey administered by a hospital in China, to examine the relations between an individual's mental health and the influencing factors. This paper proposes an unsupervised machine learning  method to determine the relationship between mental health and an array of built environment factors. The ML method comprises feature selection and association rule mining   and can process several dependent or independent variables simultaneously. It can also generate a concurrence relationship between different variables automatically\n. The understanding and knowledge garnered from using the proposed ML can assist with the planning and managing of the design and construction of urban environments and thus improve people's mental health.",
        "5": " . Material and Method\n\nThe study design of this paper is shown in  . Specifically, based on the review of existing scholarly papers, this study first identified the contextual factors within the built environment affecting the individual's mental health and designed a questionnaire. Furthermore, the questionnaire was tested by conducting a pilot survey in a large hospital. A formal survey was implemented by collecting questionnaire data and clinical diagnosis data from the neurology department of the hospital. Finally, a risk-coupling model was developed to obtain the\n\n . Contextual built environment factors influencing mental health\nimportant variables affecting people's mental health and to mine the risk relationship between important variables and mental health.",
        "6": " .. Research Instrument Development\n\nTo garner an understanding of the contextual factors within the built environment that influence an individual's mental health, scholarly papers from the PubMed and ISI Web of Science databases were reviewed. The search of keywords included built environment  and mental health . This search specifically focused on empirical-based research published between  to  , as only in the past ten years have studies focusing on the built environment have begun to emerge .\n\nA total of  research papers were identified in Appendix  Table A. The resultant analysis of these papers provided the backdrop for constructing the research instrument used to examine the influence of the built environment on people's mental health. Based on a detailed analysis of the  articles, a network diagram of the relationship between the researchers and the built environment factors was established .\n\nAs shown in  , the white circle identifies the  articles. The\ncolored circle emerging from white circles represents contextual factors in the corresponding literature. The blue is represented as housing, orange as the indoor environment, and green as the external environment. The size of the circle denotes how often the factors have been studied. The review unearthed the main contextual factors influencing the mental health of people to be:  residential density;  inaccessibility to recreational facilities;  distance from the main street; and  pollution. From the review, the built environment factors influencing a person's mental health were identified to create the study's research instrument. The constructs contained in the instrument are:\n\n Housing: This aimed to determine if a person owns or rents an apartment, the length of inhabitation , the number of people living in the dwelling and the floor level of the residence.\n Indoor and external environment: Participants were asked to use a fivepoint Likert scale ranging from '  strongly agree to  Strongly disagree' to indicate the status of their indoor environment and surrounding environment. For example, participants were asked, \"your home and community neighbourhoods are noisy\"? Indoor environmental factors were noise, lighting, ventilation, living space, housing facilities and external environmental factors were aesthetic design, accessibility of recreation, accessibility of station, accessibility of commerce, accessibility of hospital, green space, air\nCollected data\n\n\npollution, road conditions, sidewalks conditions, traffic conditions, environment management, safety facilities  and illumination . The details of each factor and the specific meaning of the independent variables can be found in Appendix .\n\nIn addition to these built environment factors, an individual's characteristics  were considered to influence mental health. In this instance, variables such as gender, age, marital status, education level, income level and exercise, major events, heredity, and self-health assessment  were examined. Major events, for example, referred to negative life experiences that may have arisen and been exacerbated by prevailing environmental\nconditions. Often, mental illness could be heredity and therefore whether there was a history of this condition within a family was determined. 'Age' was categorized into five distinct groups:  -;  -;  -;  - and;  . Education level was scored from  'master and above',  'undergraduate or junior college',  'high school', to  'Junior high school and below'. A five-point Likert scale was used to gauge the income level and a self-assessment of health.",
        "7": " .. Pilot Survey\n\nA pilot survey was conducted to further check the questionnaire's reliability and validity . Initially five experts  were invited to examine the representativeness of the questions. Considering that the respondents were Chinese, the questionnaire was expressed in Chinese. A sample of patients from a Neurology Department in one of the largest public hospitals in China was then invited to complete the questionnaire. The neurology department receives more than , outpatient visits from all over the country every year. The pilot survey and further formal survey in this study were carried out in the Neurology Department of the hospital. This study was approved by the institutional review board and conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki. All respondents willing to take part in the research signed a written consent form.\n\nA total of  questionnaires were distributed with  being valid for analysis. Factor analysis was used to test the construct validity of the questionnaire. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  measure and p value for Bartlett's Test of Sphericity were . and  respectively. The KMO value calculated was higher than . and  value was lower than . , so the sample data was suitable for exploratory factor analysis . The factors' contribution to explaining the variance of each item was then determined through principal component analysis using a varimax rotation. A rotated component matrix was revealed, with four factors explaining  of the total variance. The test for the construct validity of the questionnaire showed the stability of the five domains from the exploratory factor analysis. The reliability of the questionnaire was checked using a Cronbach's Alpha  coefficient. The  for all items was . and for factors  and  they were , . and . respectively, indicating good reliability.",
        "8": " .. Survey\n\nAs mentioned above, the data for the research was drawn from an outpatient survey between February and May . The survey was conducted in the neurology department of the hospital on three random days each week. Potential participants were suspected patients over  years old. Individuals with a cognitive disability were excluded. Participants completing the written consent form and questionnaire and also agreed that the diagnostic data of their mental health status could be used in the research. Table  presents the details of all the collected data. Medically trained staff or their family members helped participants with reading difficulties or impaired vision complete the questionnaire survey.\n\nOn completion of the survey, the status of participants' mental health was obtained from psychiatrists. The psychiatrists determined a person's mental health using several instruments such as the Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory . The evaluation process of each respondent's mental health status is shown in  . Several psychiatrists performed different types of tests on each person to evaluate whether he or she had corresponding mental illnesses. After the psychiatrists' evaluation, a person's mental status was classified as having a mental disorder or not. Types of mental disorders identified included anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Noteworthy, patients often attended the department several times to receive treatment. Therefore, the respondent was only asked to participate in the survey once. In similar\n\n .

        "9": " .. Analysis Procedure\n\nThe research developed a risk-coupling model using the survey data and mental health diagnosis, as shown in  . A Boruta algorithm is performed to obtain the important variables affecting people's mental health from a variable pool. Then an association rule algorithm is used to mine the risk relationship between important variables and mental health.",
        "10": " ... Feature Selection\n\nThe Boruta algorithm is a robust and unbiased approach that deploys bagging schemes and statistical confidence tests to select factors . It has a low computation time and error rate compared with other feature selection techniques . The Boruta algorithm is a wrapper feature selection method built around the random forest classification algorithm and can analyze the classification features of complex interactions and determine their importance . Thus, the Boruta algorithm is used to exclude variables that do not affect an individual's mental health.\n\nThe Boruta algorithm iteratively creates a 'shadow' feature for each feature by rearranging the values of the originals based on the sample data. The 'shadow' feature is a reference for selecting important features. Specifically, the first step is the addition of randomness to the sample data by generating a 'shadow' feature, which can form an extended dataset with 'shadow' features and the mixed samples.\n\nNext, a random forest classifier is built. The random forest classifier consists of many decision trees that are obtained by multiple random sampling and node random splitting techniques . The establishment of each tree requires the random extraction of features\nfrom all variables and the selection of samples by Bootstrap sampling method from all mixed samples. The extracted features become nodes of the decision tree. Two model parameters, namely, ntree and mtry, need to be optimally adjusted when establishing a random forest model to classify and predict the mental state. ntree refers to the number of classification regression trees in the forests, and mtry is the number of variables that can be selected at each node of the tree. The two parameters are closely related to the accuracy and efficiency of the model. The Gini index is used to split rules and reflect the probability of inconsistent category labels for two random samples from the dataset. K-fold cross-validation is used for model tuning to find super-parameters that optimize the generalization performance of the model .\n\nThen, the next step is to run the random forest model on the mixed samples and calculate the decreased accuracy of each variable. The decreased accuracy of each variable is the value of the decrease in model accuracy when the variable is not in the model. The decreased accuracy of each variable is regarded as a measure of the feature's importance in the random forest model, expressed as FImpi for -th feature. In each random forest model, the importance of shadow feature ShadowImp is also calculated. Of all the shadow features, the largest ShadowImp is recorded as ShadowMax and the mean importance for shadow features is calculated as ShadowMean. Features that are more important than ShadowMax are marked 'important', and other features are considered 'tentative'. All 'shadow' features are finally removed. This process is repeated until all features are designated as 'important' and no 'tentative' features are observed.",
        "11": " ... Risk Relationship Mining\n\nAssociation Rule Mining  is introduced to examine the characteristics of the coupled relationships between different influencing types for mental disorders . Before mining ARs, several key concepts are introduced.  represents a set of items. Itemset I is the subset of a set of items, . For the association\n\n . The process of feature selection and risk relationship mining\nrule analysis, the input data is a set of transactions , where each transaction , is an itemset. An itemset I occur in a transaction  if . The common form of association rules is as follows:  , where  are non-empty disjoint itemset.  are called the antecedent and the consequent of the rule  respectively. The support  and the confidence , respectively describe the functionality and certainty of the association rule. The formulas for  and  are shown in Equations  and .\n\n,\nwhere  is the number of transactions containing the itemset  is the total number of transactions, and  is the number of transactions containing the itemset .\n\nLift is used to evaluate the reliability of the rule, as calculated in Equation .\n,\nwhere  is the number of transactions containing itemset . The lift indicates the effectiveness and importance of the AR . Lift  means that the Y is likely to appear with X , which means these rules potentially useful for affecting and predicting the consequent in future data sets.\n\nAn Apriori algorithm is introduced to mine the ARs . The Apriori algorithm follows a process of iteration. The Apriori algorithm has been identified as one of the most robust approaches in\nmining frequent itemsets and determining relevant association rules . Following the feature selection , only important variables are retained to perform ARM. All sample data are pre-processed into a transaction data format. Options - for the indoor and external environmental data are converted into risk items of corresponding factors in the database. After setting the initial minimum confidence and supports, all individual items in the transaction database D become the candidate -item sets. The support of all individual items is calculated. Those items with support greater than the minimum are retained, which generates frequent -itemsets L. Then, the candidate  -item sets based on L is found. The database D is scanned and the support of the candidate  -item is compared with minimum support to generate frequent -itemsets L. The above steps are repeated to generate frequent k-itemsets Lk until frequent itemsets are unable to be extended and the process ends. Finally, all the frequent itemsets are put together and strong ARs are found that satisfy the minimum confidence from the frequent itemsets.\n\nTwo groups of rules are mined:  R rules concerning the relationship between built environment factors;  R rules concerning having mental disorders. The thresholds of minimum support and confidence are required to discover meaningful ARs. In general, when the support threshold decreases, the number of rules usually increases. The lift threshold is selected to filter valid ARs. A sensitivity analysis on the support threshold, lift threshold and the number of rules is conducted to determine the appropriate parameter values.\n\nAmong the many valid ARs, coupling relations and key factors need\n\n . Sample characteristics\nto be further found. Rule ranking can help identify the most valuable ARs. The notion of rule interestingness can evaluate the generated ARs . Several objective measures of rule interestingness are combined to retain the candidate rules by using average ranking.",

The factors in the model provide a good prediction of the mental state.\n\nAfter using the Boruta algorithm to select feature variables, the factors that influence mental health were identified . In  , the green boxes ShadowMin, ShadowMean, ShadowMax represent the minimum, average, and maximum values of the importance for the 'shadow' variable. The purple, light blue, and orange boxes represent unimportant, tentative, and important variables, respectively. The tentative variable is determined as an unimportant variable. Among all the factors investigated, traffic congestion, accessibility of green space, age of occupants, air pollution, and accessibility of recreational facilities are the top five factors that have an impact on mental health. With regard to environmental factors, traffic congestion, accessibility of green space, and air pollution play important roles in threatening mental health. Heredity conditions, home ownership, and living floor were found to have no effect on an individual's mental health. Therefore,  risk factors are considered in this research.",

For each rule, psychiatrists were asked whether patients had expressed concerns about the environmental conditions, such as the absence of green spaces, street lighting and traffic congestion in Rule  and whether the derived rules reflected their observations. The examples of the comments made during the interviews by psychiatrists include:\n\nPsychiatrist A: \"In some residential areas with a lack of greenery and poor environment management, there is usually very little communication between neighbors, and most of them just stay indoors, which easily causes people discomfort.\"\n\nPsychiatrist B: \"Because there is no greenery in the community and the environment is deteriorating, patients are reluctant to move in the\ncommunity after returning home, they have less physical activity, and they rarely communicate with their neighbors.\"\n\nAll five psychiatrists stated that some patients had referred to the issues contained within rules during their diagnosis process. For example, some patients reported that they were dissatisfied with the environment in the community as there was almost no greenery and the surrounding environment was deemed to be untidy.

Distribution of  rules about environmental factors and mental health\ninfluencing mental disorders. This finding aligns with existing evidence that has found that people living in communities with less green space and cleanliness reported worse mental health . Access to parks and green spaces within neighbourhoods was found to be significantly associated with positive mental health  However, the influence of environmental degradation on mental health is a line of inquiry that has only received superficial attention within the context of the built environment. An issue that has hindered progress in this important area is the inability to define and accurately quantify the meaning of environmental degradation. The findings that have been unearthed in this paper add further weight to the on-going research that aims to provide evidence of the link between environmental degradation and a person's mental health . Furthermore, this finding supports the development of urban planning and management policies focusing on people's mental health when considering the construction and redevelopment of infrastructure in cities.\n\nA limited number of researchers have paid attention to the co-effects of environmental degradation and the absence of green spaces on people's mental health . However, considering the findings from this study, it can be assumed that environmental degradation may be a mediator influencing the relationship between a person's mental health and green space. According to Wang et al. , the absence of green spaces may result in people ignoring environment management. As a consequence people reduce their outdoor social interaction which in turn has an impact on their mental health. This explanation is also consistent with the strong correlation between green spaces and environmental degradation presented in Section ..\n\nIn previous studies, there have been several mediatory pathways that have contributed to the effect of green space on mental health, for example, increasing social cohesion in neighborhoods, reducing environmental disturbances , and providing infrastructure for people to be able to physically exercise . However, a limited number of studies have paid attention to the relationship between environmental degradation and the absence of green spaces, and mental illness. The research in this paper addresses, in part, this gap in the literature.\n\nAnother key risk pattern identified is that people who feel physically\nill are more likely to have poor mental health, especially when living in an area where available green spaces are absent. Research has previously verified that a person's physical health status  or a poor living environment  may affect mental health. However, there have been no studies, to the authors' knowledge, that have investigated the mediatory path among mental health, physical health and green space . Thus, the  of this research enable the following hypothesis to be derived and tested in future studies: A lack of accessible greenery adversely influences people's mental health through the mediator of physical health.\n\nThe promotion of urban planning for healthy behaviours and safety is one of the five actions identified by World Health Organisation  as being central to improving people's health in cities. Considering the complex array of issues  that influence people's mental health, it is essential that the impact of the built environment is also examined . With advances in artificial intelligence and access to ever-increasing amounts of data, we are now positioned to better understand the relationship and dynamics of people and the urban environment. For example, obtaining and collecting the locations and trajectories of residents and remote sensing images can quantify dynamic exposure to urban green space and pollutants . The textual data from social media platforms, such as Weibo  that reflects the feelings and cognitions of urban residents can be used as an effective source to mine opinions and understand public awareness of environmental issues.",
        "18": " . \n\nThis paper examined the built environment-mental health relationship by combining feature extraction and ARM method. While the impact of different built environment factors on people's mental health has received widespread attention, the  presented in this study demonstrate that environmental degradation and the absence of green spaces are significant determinants. Thus, there is a need for built environment professionals  to put greater emphasis on incorporating green spaces and environment management strategies into housing developments. Environmental degradation and physical health may be the key mediators of the relationship between\ngreen space and mental health. This study will inspire future further research and planning practices about the built environment factors influencing mental well-being. With the increasing need to create sustainable and liveable cities, the research in this paper will contribute to the development of urban planning and management policies to create environments that support people's positive mental health.\n\nThis study however does have limitations that need to be acknowledged. The data derived from this research only took a 'snap shot' of a person's mental health rather than a longitudinal line of inquiry about their overall psychological well-being, which could only point directly to correlation, not the cause-effect relationship between the built environment factors and people's mental health. In the future, longitudinal studies are needed to establish a solid pathway from built environment factors to mental health status."
