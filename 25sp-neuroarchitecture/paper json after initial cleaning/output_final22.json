        "5": " \n\nUrban green spaces are crucial for alleviating psychological stress, but the effect of multisensory experiences on psychological restoration remains underexplored. This study, conducted in Edinburgh, Scotland, with  participants, compares the effects of walking and sitting in different urban environments-built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces-on psychological restoration. The  reveal that while sensory quality positively correlates with psychological well-being, sensory perception and variety do not always have a positive effect on restoration. Moreover, supplementing visual and hearing experiences with tactility and smell in urban green spaces is more effective in reducing stress and enhancing overall well-being, particularly in terms of vitality, which is largely affected by non-visual sensory inputs. This study highlights the importance of creating balanced sensory environments in urban green spaces, integrating a variety of sensory experiences to maximize psychological benefits. These findings provide valuable insights for urban planners and designers aiming to optimize green spaces for enhanced mental health and overall quality of life.\n\n\n multi-sensory experiences; urban green spaces; mental health; environmental psychology; human well-being",
        "6": " . \n\nSince the s, the world has entered a phase of rapid urbanisation. By the st century, urban development has increasingly tended towards high density . It is estimated that by , over  of the world's population will be living in urban areas . A densely developed urban artificial environment exerts tremendous pressure on urban resources  and raises concerns regarding the negative impacts on the health and well-being of urban residents . For instance, crowded urban populations can foster and exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases ; highly intensive urban environments increase the risk of severe mental disorders among residents ; various urban pollutants can significantly raise negative emotions ; and a high-pressure and fast-paced urban lifestyle leads to chronic fatigue, stress, and anxiety, making people more prone to chronic diseases, such as obesity  and hypertension . The relationship between urban green spaces and public health has always been a focal point in urban planning research . Studies have shown that mental health issues are the most easily overlooked health crises, even though the state of mental health is crucial to the well-being of individuals, communities, and society as a whole .\n\nClark et al. were the first to establish a link between the built urban environment and mental health and identify green spaces as one of the most significant factors . Subsequent studies have demonstrated that exposure to green environments positively affects mental health . Jonides et al. found that walking in natural environments\nsuch as forests is more effective in reducing fatigue, restoring attention, and enhancing cognitive abilities than walking in urban areas based on grey spaces . Some researchers have found that urban residents living in areas with higher levels of greenery generally experience lower psychological stress and higher life satisfaction . Other studies have indicated that exposure to green environments, such as wooded green spaces in cities, with their rich biodiversity and multi-sensory experiences, can improve sleep quality, reduce the incidence of emotional disorders, and mitigate behavioural deviations caused by negative emotions . The prevalence of activities such as forest therapy , the  min park effect , horticultural therapy , and restorative gardens  further supports the notion that interacting with green spaces, whether next to or within urban areas, is an effective way to improve physical fitness, alleviate stress, and restore attention.\n\nStress Reduction Theory  and Attention Restoration Theory  hold significant positions in research on the multifaceted positive impacts of green environments on psychological restoration . In , Roger Ulrich proposed the SRT, which posits that exposure to natural environments can reduce mental and physical stress, enhance cognitive ability and behavioural performance, and promote health improvement . The ART, proposed by Stephen Kaplan in , identifies four characteristics of natural environments that aid attention restoration-Being away, Extent, Compatibility, and Fascination-which help recover directed attention fatigued by the demands of daily life . Experts and scholars are working to further elucidate the mechanisms through which green spaces affect residents' mental health. Dong et al. found that green visual exposure, the green view index, and the green space ratio positively impact residents' mental health, with different measurement indicators having different mediating variables in their pathways of influence . Zhao et al. investigated the effect of audio-visual combinations on the perceived restorative potential of urban green spaces and demonstrated that the degree of matching between auditory-visual associations and visual landscapes is crucial for enhancing the restorative capacity of sounds . Other studies have indicated that visual, hearing, and smelling inputs in green spaces contribute to psychological restoration, thereby alleviating stress and attention fatigue . Although the health benefits of green spaces have been confirmed, the specific mechanisms through which they operate are still being explored, with sensory landscapes in green spaces being essential.\n\nSensory experiences typically include vision, hearing, smell, tactile sensations, and taste, which are the most direct ways humans perceive the world. Green spaces provide positive stimulation to the eyes, ears, mouth, nose, and touch, relax nerves, and regulate brain waves, thereby eliminating fatigue and uplifting the spirit . As early as the late th century, sensory experiences were used as an important therapeutic method to treat psychological disorders, such as neurasthenia . Studies on the psychological restorative benefits of visual stimuli indicate that spatial, colour, and form designs in landscapes can create a sense of changing scenery, thereby providing rich visual experiences and achieving mental healing. In terms of hearing experiences, Vanhecke et al. emphasised that a balanced combination of natural sounds, especially birdsong, could better promote human health . Regarding smell, pleasant and suitable scents can soothe nerves, calm the mind, and relieve stress . Rich and pleasant tactile experiences in green spaces can stimulate visitors' desire to explore an area, enhancing their sense of participation and identification with the environment . In terms of taste, Hill pointed out that taste is actually a combination of smell, flavour, and texture, with smell playing a major role . The Association for Psychological Science states that the influence of taste on psychological restoration is relatively minor compared to other senses . Taste is usually less directly associated with environments that do not provide food and beverages, and the taste experiences available in urban spaces are limited, typically found only in certain sections of botanical gardens where edible plants are present . Therefore, this study focuses on sensory experiences related to vision, hearing, smell, and tactile stimuli.\n\nSeveral studies have explored the relationship between urban green spaces and residents' mental health, as well as potential mediating factors . For example, green\nspaces can promote mental restoration by improving air quality , reducing noise , and providing visual stimulation . Additionally, green spaces can enhance residents' physical fitness and foster neighbourhood interactions by providing spaces for outdoor and social activities , thereby increasing life satisfaction and mental relaxation. However, research on the specific mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration remains limited . Studies have shown that human perception of the external world is formed through the interaction of multiple sensory organs . A theory by the German aesthetician Fechner emphasises the importance of multi-sensory integration in aesthetic experiences, suggesting that only through the combined action of multiple senses can people fully and deeply appreciate beauty . However, existing research has largely focused on the impact of single dimensions of sensory experience, particularly vision  and hearing , as well as the combined effects of visual and hearing stimuli ; relatively few studies have examined other sensory organs or multisensory integration . Regarding sensory experience indicators, previous research has primarily focused on perception and quality. Perception can be understood as 'whether a particular sensory experience in the environment is present or noticed' . Xu et al. integrated multi-sensory perception, behavioural experience, and landscape preference into a single framework, demonstrating that perception can serve as a key evaluation factor for sensory landscapes in green spaces . Quality refers to whether a particular sensory experience in an environment brings about subjective well-being or pleasure . In fact, previous studies using single/multi-sensory scales did not distinguish between the two sensory characteristics of perception and quality. Descriptors indicating quality  and perception descriptors without subjective adjectives  often appeared at the same category . To avoid introducing researchers' subjective biases and explore the different effects of perception and quality, this study sets separate questions for these two indicators. Furthermore, based on the experiments by Liu et al. , the variety of sounds in the environment is also a key factor in visitors' sensory experiences. This study hypothesised that similar effects may occur in other sensory experiences, leading to the  of the variety indicator. Additionally, most related research has been limited to longitudinal studies of urban green spaces as a broad category, lacking a systematic exploration of how different types of urban spaces promote psychological restoration through sensory experiences . These gaps provide important research directions and entry points for this study.\n\nThis study aimed to explore the impact of sensory experiences on psychological restoration by comparing walking and sitting in three different urban spaces. Specific research questions included the following:  What are the differences in sensory experiences between walking and sitting in a built environment, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces?  What are the differences in the psychological restoration effects of walking and sitting in built environments, semi-natural green spaces, and natural green spaces?  How do these sensory experiences collectively influence psychological restoration? This study aimed to reveal the unique role of sensory experiences in different urban spaces and uncover the mechanisms by which sensory experiences affect psychological restoration, thereby providing scientific evidence for green space design and environmental therapy.",
        "7": " . Materials and  \n\nAccording to experimental  in a large number of previous studies regarding the restoration effect of different types of space on people , it is relatively common and effective to select appropriate groups of people as samples and fill in scales after completing the corresponding experimental procedures in sites. Based on our experimental goals, we chose this approach and made corresponding designs for the experiment.",
        "8": " .. Study Sites\n\nField experiments were conducted in various urban spaces within the city of Edinburgh, selected for their distinct characteristics. Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, is\nrenowned for its unique history and culture, with architectural styles that blend medieval and Georgian influences. The city's streets are winding, lined with bustling shops and interspersed with numerous green spaces.\n\nScholars have classified urban spaces into three categories: large-scale urban green infrastructure, such as public parks and urban forests; small-scale urban green infrastructure, such as community gardens; and grey infrastructure, such as streets . Other studies have defined public green spaces within urban environments as natural or semi-natural areas and spaces modified by human activity . Based on previous research, this study identifies and categorizes three types of urban spaces for comparative analysis according to the degree of exposure to greenery and the built environment experienced by people within these spaces. The categories are as follows: built environment , which includes urban spaces where the average green view rate is less than  throughout the area; semi-natural green space , which encompasses urban spaces with an average green view rate between  and  across the area; and natural green space , defined as urban spaces with an average green view rate exceeding  throughout the area . For the experiments, Grove Street, Gardner's Crescent Community Garden, and the Rock Garden at the Edinburgh Royal Botanic Garden were chosen as the experimental sites corresponding to these three types of spaces, respectively, with detailed location descriptions provided in Table .\n\n\nFigure . Location, size and on-site natural images of study sites .",
        "9": " .. Participants \n\nForty participants , aged - years were recruited through social media. All of the participants were current students from various disciplines at the University of Edinburgh. They were asked to maintain a regular schedule and avoid staying up late for three days before the experiment. During the experiment, they were required to abstain from alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and food intake, as well as refrain from using electronic devices and communicating with other participants. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. No physical or physiological data were collected. All of the participants remained anonymous and provided signed informed consent. This study did not require submission to the ethics committee for review, according to the University Research Ethics Policy of the University of Edinburgh.",
        "10": " .. Experimental Design\n\nThe same experimental procedure was applied across the three different experimental sites, as follows: Before entering the site, participants were guided to a rest area where the researchers explained the purpose of the study, the experimental procedure, and the data analysis . The participants voluntarily signed a written consent form and provided their basic information . Next, the participants completed the Restorative Outcome Scale   and Subjective Vitality Scale   before entering the experimental site. The first phase of the experiment involved a  min walk within the site, during which the participants were free to choose their own visiting routes. After the walk, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, Perceived Restorative Scale  , and a sensory experience scale , as well as answer open-ended questions about their sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Subsequently, the participants were required to sit on a bench within the site and observe the surrounding environment for  min . After this observation period, they were asked to complete the same set of scales and answer the open-ended questions again. The experiment at each site lasted - min .\n\nAll  participants participated in the experiments at all three sites, with group sizes ranging from  to  participants per session. The participants were instructed to quietly, independently, and freely experience the sites to minimize the impact of participants on each other . During the experiment, environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, illumination, and decibel levels were measured , and these mea-\nsurements were used to control for environmental influences on the experimental . A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed no significant differences in these environmental variables across different sites. The experiment was conducted from  May to  June , with the timing determined by Edinburgh's temperate maritime climate and latitude. May to June is springtime in Edinburgh, when outdoor conditions are favourable and the experimental sites offer a rich sensory experience. The specific dates of the experiment were arranged according to the participants' schedules and weather conditions . The participants completed the entire experimental procedure at all three sites, either between : AM and : PM or between : PM and : PM .\n\nFigure . Experimental procedures.",
        "11": " .. Measurements \n\nDuring the experiment, the participants were asked to complete the ROS, SVS, PRS, and sensory experience scales . All of the scales were measured using a -point Likert scale, with ratings ranging from   to  .\n\nFirst, the ROS is based on the SRT and ART and is used to assess participants' psychological responses in natural and green spaces . Second, the SVS focuses on individuals' intrinsic motivation, energy levels, and positive emotions, reflecting their vitality and health status in daily life . The PRS, also based on the ART, is used to evaluate participants' perceived restorative potential in specific environments, particularly how well these environments help alleviate psychological and physiological fatigue . The scale covers several environmental characteristics, such as Being away , Extent , Fascination , and Compatibility . The PRS comprises  items . As the PRS is specifically designed to assess attention restoration, this study omitted the item 'My attention and alertness are significantly improved here' from the original ROS.\n\nThe sensory experience scale addresses four sensory dimensions: vision, hearing, smelling, and tactility. As described in Section , based on previous research and expert consultations, we used perception, quality, and variety as indicators for each sensory experience and developed the corresponding scales . Perception refers to the awareness and experience of environmental landscape elements through various senses, emphasising the amount and intensity of information received by an individual . Quality refers to the overall satisfaction and enjoyment of various sensory experiences, focusing on the harmony and comfort of these experiences . Variety refers to the number and types of different sensory experiences, reflecting the richness and variability of sensory experiences .\n\nFinally, to further clarify the specific content of the sensory experiences provided by the three urban environments and their effects on the participants, as well as to supplement these scale , we set two open-ended questions. The first question aimed to understand the participants' perceptions of sensory landscape elements in the three urban spaces: 'Please describe in a sentence your most memorable visual, hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in site you just visited '. The second question explored participants' subjective physiological and psychological changes: 'Please describe in a sentence how you felt and what changes you experienced after visiting the site '. The participants were instructed to answer freely, with no word limits.",

Similarly, visual perception in the NGS was significantly stronger than in the other two urban spaces. However, people were more likely to notice hearing landscapes in the SGS. In terms of sensory quality, Figure b shows that all four senses followed the order NGS  SGS  BE, although the visual difference between the SGS and BE was not significant. Regarding sensory variety, Figure c shows that the NGS offered significantly more variety across all four senses than the SGS. The variety of hearing, smelling, and tactile experiences in the SGS was much higher than that in the BE. However, in terms of vision diversity, the BE offered more variety than the SGS.",
        "16": " ... Text Mining  About the Open Question on Sensory Experiences\n\nThis study analysed the co-occurrence network of high-frequency words  from the responses to the first question to explore the impact of the three urban spaces and different intervention modes on sensory experience. In the co-occurrence network shown in Figure , the most frequently occurring words are primarily nouns and adjectives. Nouns represent specific elements in an environment that attract sensory attention, whereas adjectives reflect the positive or negative nature of these experiences. Across all intervention modes in the three environments, high-frequency words related to visual landscapes outnumbered those related to other sensory experiences. However, in the NGS, high-frequency words associated with non-visual sensory experiences were\n\nFigure . Interaction graphs for vision , hearing , smell , and tactility .

Note: BE = built environment; SGS = semi-natural green space; and NGS = natural green space.\nAdditionally, many nouns in the BE co-occurrence network were associated with artificial elements and were accompanied by more negative adjectives. The participants in the BE typically noted streets/roads, hurried people, vehicles such as trucks, bridges, shops such as cafés, entry doors, and small private gardens. They frequently reported hearing vehicles, construction, sirens, and people talking. Tactile experiences often involved buildings, walls, steps, and stones, whereas smell experiences were associated with exhaust, stench, and garbage. Although the participants occasionally described their visual experiences in BE in positive terms such as 'good', 'beautiful', 'lovely', and 'interesting', negative adjectives such as 'bad', 'dirty', 'uncomfortable', 'monotonous', 'noisy', and 'cold' were more common. By contrast, text analysis for the NGS revealed that participants generally perceived the space to be rich in natural elements, high in the degree of exposure to greenery, less in the built environment experienced by people, and conducive to positive sensory experiences. Descriptions frequently included terms such as 'beautiful landscapes or scenery', 'birdsong', 'talking', and the 'sounds of waterfalls and streams'. Tactile experiences involved natural elements, such as grass, leaves, rocks, pine, and petals, whereas smelling experiences were linked to the scents of grass, vegetation, and streams. Participants commonly used positive adjectives like 'good', 'pleasant', 'relaxing', and 'comfortable' to describe their experiences in the NGS. The SGS was perceived as a middle ground between the NGS and BE. Consistent with the repeated measures ANOVA  in Table  and Figure , the sensory experience ranking across the three urban spaces was as follows: NGS  SGS  BE.\n\nFurthermore, text analysis of sensory experiences showed that, in all urban spaces, participants tended to focus on specific, static objects while walking, whereas their visual perception expanded while sitting, allowing them to capture more dynamic moments. For example, in the BE, walking participants were more likely to notice streets, plants, shops, and cafés, while sitting led them to focus more on vehicles, people, and bridges. In the NGS and SGS, sitting broadened participants' observations beyond the immediate environment, introducing words like 'blue' and 'cloud' to describe the sky. While sitting in the NGS, participants also noted flying insects and passing pedestrians, and in the SGS, they paid attention to dynamic elements such as dogs playing in the grass and elderly people exercising. Tactile and smell experiences were affected by the intervention mode across different spaces. Sitting tended to limit participants' tactile and smell perceptions, restricting their attention to nearby surroundings and resulting in less diverse experiences than walking. Text analysis suggested that the intervention mode had minimal impact on hearing input.",

According to the pairwise comparison , the order of scores for these two dimensions across the three spaces was consistent—NGS  SGS  BE. This indicates that urban spaces with a higher average green\nview rate are more effective in helping individuals escape from daily tasks and stress, making it easier for their needs and expectations to be met, thus facilitating better mental restoration. However, the intervention mode and its interaction with place did not have a significant impact on the scores in these two dimensions. Similarly, Fascination showed significant differences only between spaces. Pairwise comparison  indicated that the scores for the NGS  and SGS  were similar, and both were significantly higher than those for the , suggesting that green, natural spaces are more conducive to restoring directed attention than grey, artificial spaces. The Extent score showed significant differences between the different types of urban spaces  and was influenced by the intervention mode . Pairwise comparisons indicated that the scores for the SGS  and  were similar and both much lower than those for the NGS .

        "19": " ... Text Mining  about the Open Question on Restorative Effects \n\nFor the participants' self-reported psychological experiences in different places and intervention modes, we applied a correspondence analysis and visualised the two key characteristic dimensions from the . In Figure , the circles represent high-frequency words, and the squares represent places and intervention modes. Their positions and directions indicate the similarities or differences between objects, and the quadrants show the classification of objects across different dimensions. The percentage for each dimension reflects its importance in explaining the total variance in the data . Consistent with the previous analysis, the mental restorative effects in the BE and NGS differed significantly, with the SGS falling between the two. In the BE, both sitting and walking are closely associated with negative emotion words such as 'irritated', 'nervous', 'bored', 'annoying', 'noisy', and 'irritable'. In the SGS, both sitting and walking are linked with words like 'calmer', 'quiet', 'sleepy', and 'stable', reflecting the comfortable psychological state provided by this environment. Additionally, words like 'meditation', 'thought', 'think', 'association', and 'daily' suggest that participants in the SGS can escape daily worries, immerse themselves in the green space, and engage in deep reflection, although they may also feel 'cold' while sitting. In the NGS, both sitting and walking are associated with words such as 'relax', 'calm', 'comfortable', 'safe', 'deep breath', 'good', 'happy', and 'curiosity', indicating that the NGS fosters positive emotions and provides effective psychological restoration.\n\nFigure .

        "22": " .. Sensory Experiences and Psychological Restoration Effects across Different Places and Intervention Modes\n\nPrevious studies have consistently demonstrated that in urban spaces, green areas with a higher presence of natural elements exhibit stronger restorative effects, whereas green spaces dominated by built elements tend to have weaker restorative effects . Even within restorative environments, the positive effects can vary depending on the specific environmental setting . The findings of this study support this perspective. In all the psychological scales , the NGS with abundant vegetation, wildlife, water features, and varied topography scored the highest. These were followed by the SGS that are surrounded by urban roads and buildings and feature lawns and limited vegetation. By contrast, grey spaces , characterised by an abundance of artificial elements and minimal front-yard greenery, showed the lowest restorative effects and may even have had negative impacts.\n\nThis study also found that different types of urban spaces resulted in significantly different sensory experiences. The overall evaluations of vision, hearing, smell, and tactile sensation, as well as the scores for each sense on the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety, generally aligned with the order of psychological restoration effects, namely, NGS  SGS  BE.\n\nHowever, in terms of vision experience, the difference between the BE and SGS was not significant. Further analysis of specific indicators revealed that while the BE showed higher vision variety, its vision quality was lower than that of the SGS. The BE, represented by the street, includes a variety of visual information. For example, in the first open-ended question, many participants visually focused on buildings, shops, and entry doors along the street, with these elements providing readable text and increasing colour richness. However, such complex and diverse visual elements do not necessarily contribute to a sense of pleasure. Vehicles, traffic signs, and other elements often detract from the aesthetic appeal of a landscape . Moreover, the  of hearing perception indicate that the ranking\nof the three urban spaces  was the exact opposite of the decibel levels recorded by the researcher , suggesting that, in urban environments within the  range, people's attention to sound is not determined by objective loudness . To some extent, people become accustomed to certain noises in a street environment and ignore them , although some of the participants still noted the disruptive nature of traffic and construction noises. Combined with psychological restoration outcomes , the ROS scores in the BE significantly decreased after entering, and the Fascination score in the BE was much lower than that in the other two spaces. This indicates that individuals in the BE still experienced high levels of stress and were unable to achieve a state of relaxation, comfort, and clear, rational thinking. The findings also suggest that the BE lacked attractiveness and failed to capture individuals' attention naturally. Consequently, the BE led to residents being unable to immerse themselves in their surroundings, with diminished and fragmented attention, making it easier to overlook sounds in the environment. According to the text analysis  , in the two green spaces, positively rated sounds, such as birdsong, talking, wind, and water, attracted attention. In the SGS, vehicle and construction noises that disrupted these natural and harmonious sounds also received attention. Combining the evaluations of sensory perception and variety with the text analysis  , we found that the sensory experiences in the BE and SGS were primarily based on vision and hearing stimuli, whereas the NGS offered significantly richer tactile and smell experiences than the other two places. This multi-sensory experience enhances the sense of immersion and contributes to psychological restoration . This was also reflected in the Extent scores during activities in the NGS, which are much higher than those in the BE and even higher than those in the SGS. This suggests that urban spaces closer to nature can provide sufficient opportunities for exploration and good coherence and connectivity among environmental elements, allowing people to become immersed in the setting and lose track of time . By contrast, small green spaces or entirely artificial environments segmented by man-made elements have limitations in providing consistency and a sense of security.\n\nUnlike the impact of space type, the main effects of intervention modes on sensory experience were not significant. Hearing experiences across the three spaces remained largely consistent regardless of intervention mode. This can be attributed to the threedimensional nature of sound, which can propagate widely through space , meaning that environmental sounds can be heard by individuals even at a considerable distance from the source. Additionally, as environmental sounds such as traffic, wind, water, and talking are persistent , and participants in this study were only required to stay briefly at the three experimental sites, they may have been exposed to similar auditory inputs within that short time frame, thereby reducing the impact of the intervention mode on the hearing experience. In terms of tactile experience, walking was found to be better than sitting. This is because sitting limits the range of physical activity and narrows the field of vision, thus reducing the level of interaction with the environment and significantly decreasing the number of objects that can be touched or that evoke a desire to touch . Correspondingly, in terms of psychological restoration effects, Extent of the PRS, which assesses whether the environment provides sufficient scope and depth, was also influenced by similar factors; scores were higher during walking than sitting across all spatial types. Sitting restricted the participants' interactions with the environment through close-range senses , leading to lower evaluations of the expansiveness and coherence of the space. Moreover, while walking, people are more likely to observe stationary objects, whereas sitting in one corner of a site allows for an expanded field of view, making it easier to observe dynamic moments. This phenomenon is related to human visual attention and perception mechanisms; during movement, the visual system reduces its sensitivity to dynamic s to minimise distractions, allowing for a greater focus on obstacles in the path. When sitting, with the body requiring little movement, the visual system is less burdened and can allocate attention more freely, thus providing it more resources to process dynamic information in the surrounding environment . Additionally,\nfrequent movements of the head and eyes during walking can make it more difficult for the visual system to capture fast-moving objects, whereas while sitting, the stability of the viewpoint makes it easier for the visual system to detect subtle movements, enhancing the perception of dynamic events .",
        "23": " .. The Mechanism by Which Sensory Experiences in Space Influence Psychological Restoration \n\nThis study confirmed that different types of urban spaces stimulate people's senses, leading to diverse environmental experiences that can have varying positive or negative impacts on psychological restoration.\n\nThe  indicated that sensory quality was positively correlated with various psychological assessment metrics, whereas perception and variety exhibited uncertainty. This suggests that sensory experiences of the environment are not necessarily better when they are clearer or more diverse. According to Table , vision perception primarily affects the ROS and Being away and Compatibility of the PRS, and it does so negatively. This implies that the stronger and more attention-grabbing the visual stimuli in the environment, the more difficult it is for people to relax, leading to increased mental clutter. Additionally, such environments are less effective in helping individuals forget their daily worries and satisfy their personal needs, ultimately hindering psychological restoration. This finding is consistent with the  reported by Yakinlar and Akpinar . Based on Figure a and Tables  and , it can be inferred that in spaces such as the BE  and SGS , visual distractions from negative artificial elements  make it challenging for people to establish a pleasant and natural connection. Moreover, Fascination of the PRS is negatively influenced by smell perception and vision variety. This may be because strong odours and complex landscape features can cause stress and distract attention, making it difficult for individuals to focus on their current environment . However, the findings of this study differ from those of Li et al., who found that combinations of multiple visual elements offer better restorative benefits than single elements . Therefore, further research is needed, such as conducting separate experiments for each metric, controlling variables, and setting up multi-gradient comparisons, to better understand how 'smell perception' and 'vision variety' influence perceived restoration, stress levels, and psychological health.",
        "24": " .. Research Significance and Action Implications\n\nThis study explored the role of sensory experiences in the environment as a crucial component of its psychological restorative functions, highlighting its significant research value.\nTheoretically, this study analysed sensory experiences through the dimensions of perception, quality, and variety and proposed sensory indicators and their effects on stress reduction, vitality restoration, and attention recovery, thereby filling a gap in the existing literature.\n\nPractically, first, the findings suggest that future urban planning and design should prioritize the creation of different spaces that adapt to different intervention modes and consider human visual attention and perception mechanisms when arranging pathways and seating areas , catering to the visual habits of individuals in urban spaces, such as focusing on stationary and immediate objects while walking and having an expanded field of view to capture dynamic moments when sitting. This includes designing smooth, coherent path systems for walkers, incorporating multi-sensory experiences at key points, and providing open views and dynamic visual elements in seating areas to enhance sensory experiences and psychological restoration. Second, this study advises urban planners and landscape designers to avoid overcrowding spaces with excessive design elements, because, based on this research, rich but low-quality landscapes are not necessarily pleasant and low-quality landscape design elements are often closely related to artificial elements . Therefore, planners and designers should appropriately incorporate artificial elements into natural elements to decrease and balance the negative impact of artificial features through strategic layout, the use of sound barriers, or natural barriers , even improving the perceived quality by increasing the rate of visual greenery in urban spaces with a high proportion of artificial elements. These approaches foster a more comfortable and harmonious connection between individuals and their environments. Third, future designs should place greater emphasis on the importance of multi-sensory experiences, especially smell and tactile experiences, which can be achieved through the  of aromatic plants and the creation of a varied tactile environment , thus enhancing the immersion and psychological recovery effect of the space.\n\nSocially, this study's findings provide specific recommendations for urban and landscape planners, aiding in the practical enhancement of the health benefits of urban spaces, improving residents' quality of life, and increasing their happiness and satisfaction. These improvements could contribute to reducing suicide rates , increasing community cohesion , lowering crime rates , and promoting sustainable social development.",
        "25": " .. Limitations \n\nThis study has several limitations that should be addressed in future research. First, it focused only on visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile experiences in the environment, without considering the potential value of gustatory perception. Although gustatory input plays a minor role in human sensory perception and is rarely utilised in landscape studies , it is important to acknowledge that activities and food culture are often integral to spatial experiences, and taste can contribute to feelings of pleasure and relaxation . Second, the effect of exposure time on psychological restoration requires further investigation. Ann et al. found that spending more than  min in a natural environment significantly enhances vitality . Therefore, future studies should explore whether longer periods of activity or sitting result in different psychological restoration outcomes. Third, this study's sample size was limited, which may restrict the generalisability of its findings to a broader target population. Although we attempted to control for factors such as gender, age, and occupation when recruiting participants, this study was limited to a sample of university students, which constrains the applicability of the s. Fourth, owing to cost and time constraints, this study selected only portions of urban streets, community gardens, and botanical gardens to represent the BE, SGS, and NGS urban space types, respectively. This selection may have introduced some bias. Future research should include experiments in additional green spaces within these three urban space types to supplement the current findings. Finally, beyond clarifying the differences in sensory experiences and\npsychological restoration across different urban environments and identifying the types and dimensions of sensory experiences that influence the effectiveness of spatial psychological restoration, future research should also aim to quantify the dimensional parameters of various sensory experiences through further experiments. This would provide valuable references for landscape design and planning.",
        "26": " . \n\nUrban green spaces are a crucial component of green infrastructure in cities, significantly affecting the urban ecological environment and psychological health of residents. The development of different types of urban spaces is a key focus for urban planners and policymakers. This study adopted a multi-sensory perspective to examine sensory experience characteristics, restorative benefits, and their interrelationships in an urban BE, SGS, and NGS, providing valuable recommendations for urban green space development. In terms of sensory experiences and psychological restorative functions, the NGS, which is characterised by high vegetation coverage and the dense presence of natural elements, demonstrated stronger restorative effects, followed by the SGS. This study also drew on the strengths and limitations of the existing literature by conducting a more detailed analysis of each sensory modality using the indicators of perception, quality, and variety. This revealed the potential connections between sensory experiences and psychological health restoration, offering new insights into how sensory landscapes can be more precisely utilised to create effective urban healing spaces. Multi-sensory experiences in urban spaces are a promising area for further research. The roles of different sensory dimensions across various space types and population groups should be explored through additional experiments to obtain quantitative metrics. Additionally, future studies should incorporate objective physiological indicators  for more in-depth mechanistic research, thereby supporting future planning and design efforts."
