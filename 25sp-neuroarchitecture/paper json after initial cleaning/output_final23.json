        "5": " \n\nMany studies have disentangled the perceived benefits of vegetation on subjective well-being . Yet, scant attention has been paid to the joint effect of vegetation and building density on SWB. This study explores the relationship between streetscape vegetation , building density and SWB in Beijing, China. Our analysis relies on rich measures of street view data to assess SV exposure at the neighbourhood level. Notably, we distinguish between trees  and grasses  when evaluating SV metrics. The  suggest that streetscape trees and grasses are positively associated with SWB, though estimated effects are dependent upon tree and grass density exposures. We also find that the effects of streetscape trees and grass are moderated by building density in the neighbourhood. Additional decomposition analysis provides the insight that the well-being implications of street vegetation and building density are varied significantly by individual sociodemographic characteristics such as sex, age and income. The findings of this study suggest the importance of considering density in SV planning and land use policies to enhance people's quality of life.\n\n\nKEY WORDS\ndensity, modified effect, street view data, streetscape vegetation, subjective well-being",
        "6": "  \n\nExposure to the urban vegetation  is beneficial to residents' well-being  through several underlying channels at work such as facilitating capacities, preventing pollution harms and restoring capacities . First, urban vegetation can not only encourage residents to take more physical activity but also increase their neighbourhood social cohesion, both of which are beneficial for well-being . Second, previous studies pointed out that urban vegetation can prevent the negative effect of pollution harms such as heat , noise , and air pollution . Last, urban vegetation also\nhelps residents restore their capacities due to its restorative features such as compatibility and fascination . In recent years, some studies found that different urban vegetation  may have different impacts on residents' well-being . For example, Astell-Burt and Feng  found that the tree canopy is associated with better mental well-being and health, whilst exposure to grass is associated with higher prevalent psychological distress. Reid et al.  pointed out that tree density is related to better self-reported health, but grass density is not. Wang et al.  indicated that streetscape trees and grasses benefit mental health through several mechanisms .\n\nStreet vegetation has been recognised as an important form of urban vegetation for influencing residents' well-being . Yet, it has received less attention than other large green infrastructures such as parks due to data and methodological limitations . Also, whether different types of street vegetation  may have heterogeneous effects on well-being is still unclear . Most previous studies assess street vegetation through remote sensing images  or field audit . Remote sensing images can provide the distribution of street vegetation on a large scale, but it usually does not include small street vegetation and may not be applied for places where high-resolution remote sensing images are unavailable . On the contrary, the field audit method can include small street vegetation, but it is usually time-consuming and labourintensive which prevents it from being applicable to a large study area . In recent years, more and more studies begin to use street view images along with machine learning  for assessing street vegetation . This new method is more efficient than field audit and can include more small street vegetation than remote sensing images. Hence, it can also identify different street vegetation  with an appropriate training dataset, so it may be a better method for assessing street vegetation than remote sensing images and field audits, especially in a large and dense neighbourhood.\n\nBuilding density is an important component of the neighbourhood environment in influencing residents' well-being . There is a growing awareness amongst scholars that living in a neighbourhood with higher building density may have influence on residents' well-being through several pathways . First, building density may increase pollution harms such as heat, noise and air pollution within the neighbourhood which are all harmful to residents' well-being . For example, high neighbourhood building density may block the wind and lower its speed, resulting in the heat island effect which increases the temperature . Hence, high neighbourhood building density also increases the level of atmospheric pollutants, since it has influence on the shape of the street canyon and the dispersion of atmospheric pollutants . The second domain of pathway linking",
        "7": " \n\n- Green space serves as an important factor in relation to subjective well-being.\n- The association between green space and subjective well-being varies across different neighbourhood contexts.\n- In previous studies, general green space were researched in higher proportions, whilst streetscape vegetation received less attention.",
        "8": " \n\n- Both streetscape trees and grasses are positively associated with subjective well-being.\n- The association between streetscape vegetation and subjective well-being is moderated by building density.\n- The effect of streetscape vegetation is more beneficial for disadvantaged groups.\nbuilding density to well-being is associated with the use of openspace . Residents living in high neighbourhood building density have less public openspace which may decrease their outdoor physical activity and increase the prevalence of different kinds of chronic diseases . The last domain of the pathway is associated with the mental stress caused by crowding . A plethora of studies has documented that living in a crowded environment may increase residents' anxiety and depression since they get less private space and more feeling of tension in a dense environment .\n\nOur research has four contributions. First, this study adds to the literature on the association between streetscape vegetation  and subjective well-being  and further distinguishes the effect of different SV . Most previous studies measured urban vegetation  based on satellite images . However, recent studies showed that this method may ignore the effect of street-level small vegetation . Therefore, our research can improve our understanding of vegetation-SWB association by further taking SV into account. Second, it enhances our knowledge of the building density-SWB association in developing countries. Taking a dense city in China as an example, this study measures building density based on the plot ratio. In China, due to the rapid urbanisation, the population has increased dramatically in a metropolis such as Beijing and Shanghai . Therefore, the building and population density in China's metropolitan areas  is much larger than in most western countries. Third, it further identifies the joint effect of both SV and building density on SWB. Whilst a plethora of studies has disentangled the independent effect of vegetation on well-being, scant attention has been paid to the modified effect of building density . A recent\nstudy found that the effect of greenspace on life satisfaction is moderated by urban density, since people's use of greenspace may vary across different density contexts . This is particularly important in the Chinese context, where neighbourhood building density is extremely high. Last, heterogeneous effects of different socioeconomic levels for different SV  are also explored.",
        "10": " .\n\nThis study was based on the data of a survey conducted in  in Beijing. The data were collected using a multi-stage stratified PPS  sampling method. First, residential neighbourhoods from the districts of Beijing were selected . Second, sampled households from each neighbourhood were chosen. Last, we randomly chose one adult household member from each household based on the Kish Grid method as a respondent. Recent studies have shown that the respondents in this survey are representative of the population in Beijing based on census data . The survey yielded a total of  valid respondents.",
        "11": " . \n\nFollowing previous studies , SWB in this study was measured by a single question. The respondents were asked 'how do you feel about the current state of your life'. The answered item was scored using a five-point scale '  very unhappy,  unhappy,  general,  happy,  very happy'. We regarded 'very unhappy' and 'unhappy' as low SWB whilst 'general', 'happy' and 'very happy' were regarded as high SWB. We did not treat it as an ordinal variable, since using ordinal logistic regression usually violates the parallel lines assumption .",
        "13": " .. \n\nWe used street view images to assess neighbourhood streetscape greenness exposure. We collected the street view image from Tencent Map following previous studies . Street view sampling points were constructed -m apart based on the road network from OpenStreetMap . For each sampling point, we collected street view images from four degrees , as suggested by previous studies . In total, we collected more than . million street view images from , sampling points.\n\nPrevious studies show that streetscape trees and grasses have different influences on residents' well-being since streetscape trees have a stronger effect on mitigating air pollution than grasses . Therefore, we calculated both SV-trees  and SV-grasses  exposure based on street view images and a machine learning approach. Since street view data was collected within participants' residential neighbourhood, SV can reflect people's daily and visual streetscape greenness exposure . First, we trained a fully convolutional neural network  based on an online ADEK annotated images data set  for semantic image segmentation. Second, after the training process, the accuracy of the FCN-s was . and capable of identifying trees and grasses at an acceptable level. Following previous studies , SV-tree and SV-grass per sampling point were determined as the proportion of tree or grass pixels per image to the total number of pixels per image. We calculated the SV-tree and SV-grass for each neighbourhood by averaging the SV-tree and SV-grass scores for all sampling points within -metre circular buffers around the centroid of each targeted neighbourhood.",
        "14": " .. \n\nWe used the plot ratio  to assess building density in ArcGIS version .. First, residential building density data were collected from city planning documents via the urban data group , a leading data media platform in China . This data provide information on the number of floors and the total floor area for each building. Second, the net land area for each neighbourhood was calculated. Last, the plot ratio  was calculated for each neighbourhood based on the 'spatial join' command in ArcGIS.",
        "15": " . \n\nFollowing previous studies , we also controlled some socioeconomic, demographic and environment covariates. Socioeconomic covariates include homeownership , household income , educational attainment , employment status  and hukou status . Demographic covariates include gender , age  and marital status . We also included several built environment indicators including distance to the nearest park , distance to the nearest tertiary A-level hospital , and distance to the nearest subway . The information on built environment\nindicators was also collected in . All of the descriptive statistics are presented in Table .",
        "16": " . \n\nWe used the multilevel logistic regressions  to examine the associations amongst SV-tree, SV-grass and the likelihood of reporting low SWB. In the models, individuals at Level  were nested within neighbourhoods at Level . Variance inflation factors  suggested no severe multicollinearity amongst the independent variables. We used moderation analysis to explore the interaction term between SV-tree  exposure and plot ratio. First, we regressed respondents' odds of reporting low SWB on the SV-tree  exposure and plot ratio . Second, the interaction term between SV-tree exposure and plot ratio was added to Model d . Last, the interaction term between SV-grass exposure and plot ratio was added to Model d . We mainly focused on the direction and significance level of the interaction term. If the direction of the interaction term is the same as streetscape greenness exposure, then it means the effect of streetscape greenness exposure increases with building density. However, if the direction of the interaction term is the opposite of streetscape greenness exposure, the effect of streetscape greenness exposure decreases with building density. Existing literature found that the effect of greenness on well-being may vary due to people's socioeconomic and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and income . Therefore, in the next step, we conducted four exploring heterogeneous effects  to test whether the relationship between SV-tree  exposure and respondents' odds of reporting low SWB varies by different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. As for sensitivity analysis , we first changed the plot ratio to the building coverage ratio . Second, we set SWB as an ordinal variable and repeat the analysis using the multilevel ordered logit model . The analyses were performed by Stata .  using the 'melogit' commands.",

As for covariates, homeowners were less likely to report low SWB compared with non-homeowners . Compared to respondents with household income of\nless than  RMB per month, respondents with household income between -, RMB per month were less likely to report low SWB . Last, respondents' odds of reporting low SWB were positively associated with distance to the park .\n\nModel  showed the moderated effect of the plot ratio in the relationship between SV-tree and respondents' odds of reporting low SWB. There was evidence to suggest that the plot ratio modified the association between SV-tree and respondents' odds of reporting low SWB. For example, compared with living in neighbourhood with Q plot ratio, the effect of SV-tree on respondents' odds of reporting low SWB was strengthened in neighbourhood with Q plot ratio , but was weakened in neighbourhood with Q plot ratio . Model  showed the moderated effect of the plot ratio in the relationship between SV-grass and respondents' odds of reporting low SWB.

Table  showed the heterogeneous effects between male and female groups. Model a indicated that SV-tree  and SV-grass  were negatively associated with male respondents' odds of reporting low SWB.

        "19": " . \n\nThis study finds that both streetscape trees and grass are positively associated with SWB whilst building density is negatively associated with SWB. Our findings suggest that building density moderates the association between SV and SWB. Relatively lower-middle building density strengthens the positive effect of streetscape trees on SWB, whilst high building density weakens the positive effect of streetscape trees on SWB. Hence, higher-middle and high building density weaken the positive effect of streetscape grasses on SWB. Last, the effect of street streetscape trees, grasses and building density on SWB is varied significantly by individual demographic and\nsocioeconomic characteristics such as sex, age, educational attainment and income.",
        "20": " . \n\nOur  suggest that residential street trees may exert beneficial effects on SWB in an urban population. Previous studies in Australia , New York City in America  and Guangzhou  also found that neighbourhood tree canopy was positively related to health outcomes. First, street trees can reduce people's stress and help them recover from pressure . Second, street trees not only benefit people's mental well-being by decreasing objective pollution harms  but also benefit people's mental well-being through the reduction of people's subjective perceived pollution . Last, shade provision of street trees can encourage people to take more outdoor physical activity  which benefits well-being . Hence, street trees also offer people an open space for contacting others, which enhances their cohesion . Our  also suggest streetscape grass is positively associated with SWB. This is different from findings\nfrom previous studies in Australia  and America , but consistent with previous evidence in China . Reid et al.  pointed out that grasses affect health in a different way with trees, which may explain its insignificant association with health. Astell-Burt and Feng  suggested that trees are more beneficial for mental well-being since it is more supportive of biodiversity than grasses. However, a recent study in China found that street grasses also benefit people's mental well-being by decreasing objective pollution harms  and people's perceived pollution . Another reason for the inconsistency of the grass-health association may be because of the difference in the definition of street grasses . The quality of street grasses is also relevant to impose psychological restorative benefits. This study indicates that building density is negatively associated with SWB in an urban population. However, previous studies in Hong Kong found that building density was positively related to health by improving acoustic comforts . We only found a significant association between building density and SWB when the density is high enough . It means that when building density increases within the appropriate limits, it may benefit residents' SWB, but if the density is too high it may exert adverse effects on SWB.",
        "21": " . \n\nOur findings suggest that building density moderates the association between SV and SWB. Relatively lower-middle  building density strengthens the positive effect of streetscape trees on SWB, whilst high  building density weakens the positive effect of streetscape trees on SWB. This phenomenon can be explained by the following reasons:  With the slight increase in building density , the density of street tree cover may also increase. This further makes residents share a more compact open space and increases social contacts which may facilitate neighbourhood social cohesion and encourage residents to take outdoor group sports . However, when building density gets too high , the cover of the tree canopy may be too low to support a comfortable open space;  When street trees get denser, they are more likely to block different kinds of pollutants , but if the cover of the tree canopy gets too low, it can not mitigate environmental stressors such as air pollution ;  Previous studies have proven that the restorative effect of trees on stress recovery increases with a slight increase of its density, but if the density of trees gets too high, its restorative effect decreases . However, no evidence can support that the slight increase in building density may also strengthen the effect of streetscape grasses. We found that higher-middle  and high  building density weakens the positive effect of streetscape grasses on SWB. First, the cover of street grassland may become too low and dense with the increase in building density and may not support\noutdoor physical activity and social contact . Hence, a dense street grassland may cause conflict in the neighbourhood, since residents will compete for limited open space resources . Second, when street grasses get too dense, its mitigation effect on environmental stressors also decreases . Third, a dense street grassland can not offer a comfortable place for various species which may reduce its biodiversity and psychological restorative benefits .\n\nOur stratified and moderation analysis suggests that the association amongst street vegetation, building density and SWB tends to vary with individual socio-demographic factors. We found that males can benefit more from street vegetation than females which is consistent with previous studies , This may be due to the reason that males spend more time on the street for different outdoor activities than females . Street vegetation is more beneficial for young adults than for older adults. This can be explained by the reason that young adults are more likely to spend their leisure time in physical activities  on the street than older adults since they are less likely to be functionally restricted . We also found that people with low-income benefit more from street vegetation than people with high incomes. People with high income can pay for better health-related services, but people with low income have to rely on public resources such as public green infrastructures on the street .",
        "22": " . \n\nSince both streetscape trees and grass are positively associated with SWB, policy makers should improve the provision of street vegetation to promote residents' well-being. Second, the plot ratio is negatively associated with SWB, so laws and regulations regulating the building density should be perfected. Third, the effects of greenspace streetscape trees and grass may be modified by building density, so street vegetation should be planned based on the local neighbourhood building density. Last, we found that the effect of SV is more beneficial for disadvantaged groups , so more SV should be planned for deprived neighbourhoods, which may be useful narrow health inequalities and improve social justice.\n\nOur study has several limitations due to data constraints. First, our cross-sectional study design makes it difficult to infer causation between streetscape greenness exposure and SWB. Second, the duration of exposure to streetscape greenness was not taken into account and other detailed information on streetscape greenness is still unknown. This may lead to the Uncertain Geographic Context Problem regarding the influences of streetscape greenness . Third, street view data can not identify dynamic seasonal effects of changes in streetscape greenness. Hence, inconsistent collected time of survey and street view data, and errors in identification of the vegetation in the images may lead to some bias.",
        "23": "   \n\nThis study systematically investigates the role of building density in the association between street vegetation and SWB amongst people living in Chinese cities.  from statistical analyses show that both streetscape trees and grass are positively associated with SWB whilst building density is negatively associated with SWB. The moderation analysis indicates that the effects of greenspace streetscape trees and grass may be modified by building density. Hence, the decomposition analysis provides the insight that the effect of street vegetation and building density on SWB is varied significantly by individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics such as sex, age and income. The above findings highlight the importance of considering the context effect of density for urban greenness research. To create healthy cities through urban planning and design, policymakers should focus on the perceived benefits of street vegetation and building density at the neighbourhood scale."
