        "2": " \n\nGreen spaces function as integral communal areas facilitating interaction and nurturing a collective sense of community. Removing such green spaces ultimately limits the opportunities for physical activity and outdoor recreation, creating more sedentary lifestyles and a decrease in social connection. This study offers a comprehensive investigation of the benefits of green spaces for communal wellbeing  within the urban context of Lahore. The study is based on Murray Bookchin's social ecology principles and aims to understand how people may interact with their social and physical surroundings. Such research is driven by the increasing trend of urban built-up expansion, which poses considerable risk for green spaces. To achieve this objective, a field survey was conducted using a simple random sampling technique in which  respondents were examined with the help of a structured questionnaire. After collecting and screening the data, the study performed regression analysis utilizing R software to compute the services of green spaces for the community, which found significant trends (e.g. Social Well-Being; \n\n\nand Life Satisfaction;  ) statistically. Similarly, a structural model was formulated to deduce the services of green spaces for communal wellbeing. The analysis reveals a significant relationship  Urban Environment",
        "3": " \n\nThe field of social ecology focuses on the interactions and responses of individuals concerning their surrounding environment, assessing the broader impact of these interactions on society and the environment. It parallels traditional ecological studies, which explore the intricate relationship between various elements of nature, contributing to the formation of ecosystems worldwide . Developed by Murray Bookchin, social ecology is a theory that explores the dynamic and interconnected human and non-human elements in ecological systems and their social, political, and physical environments. It emphasizes the interdependence between social structures, cultural aspects, and the natural environment, viewing them as integral components of a more extensive, interrelated system . Along with this intersectional relationship, green spaces also improve the identity of a community as a whole. When residents connect to green areas within their neighbourhoods, their quality of life and satisfaction with the surrounding environment can be enhanced . This is because community well-being encompasses the blend of socio-economic, cultural, and environmental factors recognized by individuals as vital for their growth and realization of potential. It encapsulates the collective health, prosperity, and standard of life individuals experience within a defined geographical area or social group. It also goes beyond individual identity and well-being and encompasses the sustained, collective welfare of the greater community .\n\nA conducive natural environment is critical for diverse living organisms on Earth to sustain human life. For instance, they may provide essential resources such as fresh air, water, fruits, wood, and minerals to meet daily necessities . Green spaces also serve as a natural gathering spot for residents, fostering social interaction, integration, and innovation. as well as enhancing the collective individuality and belonging of the residents . Furthermore, green spaces are also effective in mitigating air pollution as the density of vegetation increases in their presence . As a result, such examples make green landscapes crucial elements within urban frameworks, as they work to represent and support various aspects of daily human life . Models of quality of life consistently highlight positive outcomes related to human health  and sustainable, progressive innovation as directly associated with the presence of green spaces . For instance, green spaces mitigate the urban heat  and urban flooding  in densely populated areas , significantly offsetting the consequences such patterns may pose , and simultaneously purify the atmosphere . The well-coordinated management of urban green landscapes is particularly beneficial in providing ecosystem services for urban\nareas. In terms of functionality, green spaces absorb carbon dioxide , emit ozone , and lower temperatures . Green spaces are thus critical for meeting the extensive demand for ecosystem services for residents and the urban environment. They offer versatile potential in sustaining the environment and facilitating human livelihood and connection within a city.\n\nGreen spaces also help to handle climatic changes and serve as a platform for social connections . They provide numerous health benefits through increased social interaction among humans or as a means of facilitating physical exercise . During the COVID- pandemic, green spaces emerged as a central hub for leisure activities, as indoor, confined spaces posed a significant risk of spreading the virus. For instance, outdoor events saw a notable increase during the lockdown compared to pre-pandemic engagements in the previous three years in areas such as Oslo, Norway . It is demonstrated that utilizing open green spaces during the pandemic yielded significant social advantages. One of the tremendous benefits was also determined to be the improved, equitable access to urban parks for poorer residents, enhancing their ability to participate in leisure activities. In contrast, increased use of such green spaces saw increased crime, noise disturbances, and inadequate cleanliness. These emerging detrimental effects of increased green spaces in urban areas may potentially cause disruption or negative consequences for the general public .\n\nAs a result of such considerations, urban communities require an effective management system to increase and maintain green landscapes . Studies have shown numerous health benefits and positive outcomes in expanding green spaces, as they offer a more equitable and accessible means to improve health, well-being, and human connection. For example, they offer opportunities for increased physical and recreational activities. Easy accessibility of green spaces allows for activities such as walking or cycling, for instance, supporting public health in urban and peripheral settings . Maintaining optimal physical health aligns with frequent visits to parks, and the frequency of such visits tends to rise with the enhanced quality, human health, ecological health, and the overall presence and accessibility\nof green landscapes . Moreover, enhancing the biophysical characteristics of urban canopy vegetation in such green spaces is essential for improving human health. Urban greenness enhances connectivity and mitigates the adverse effects of stressful urban life .\n\nSocial Well-being  is a condition where individuals can peacefully coexist in a community for progress. It can be characterized as equitable access to fundamental services to prevent community conflicts . Social isolation is a significant concern in urban residents' contemporary and hectic lifestyles. Green spaces provide space for stress relief through connection and recreational activities that enhance social interaction through their favourable environment. Different studies have analyzed that green spaces offer social interaction in many ways. Engaging in recreational activities in urban greenness fosters social connections . Frequent utilization of parks has demonstrated the ability to lower stress levels and alleviate obstacles to mental well-being in individuals. A study conducted in Scotland revealed that engaging in park activities consistently throughout the year can diminish social isolation and mitigate mental health challenges .\n\nOverall Life Satisfaction  is a subjective measure of how content people feel with the quality and state of their lives as a whole. OLS pertains to an individual's subjective assessment of their global well-being across various life domains, including but not limited to occupational engagement, interpersonal relationships, physical health, and existential fulfilment. Empirical investigations consistently highlight the significant contributions of factors such as socioeconomic status, social connectedness, and existential meaning to the formulation of overall life satisfaction . Green spaces work as a platform for social interaction and enhance the ability to participate in society actively. Active social interaction can thus be achieved in this context through better design and proximity of green spaces on a spatial scale. Social interaction promotes community well-being in any society  the increased presence and quality of green spaces are ultimately linked to improving social cohesion within neighbourhoods . Within an urban setting, green spaces play a crucial role as a significant source of\nrecreational activities, providing aesthetic enjoyment, enhancing physical health, fostering psychological well-being , and offering an educational environment .\n\nGreen spaces, such as parks, gardens, and natural areas, serve as vital components of urban landscapes by offering various opportunities for leisure, relaxation, and social interaction and contributing to environmental sustainability. They promote biodiversity and reduce urban heat . As a result, green spaces have numerous benefits for people living in urban communities. They help to make humans healthier, bring them together socially, keep the environment healthy, boost the economy, and add richness to the culture of the community. These spaces are essential for making communities pleasing and lively places to reside in. Despite the wealth of literature highlighting the positive impacts of greenness on communal well-being, a critical gap persists in the current research available. For instance, while existing studies acknowledge the benefits of green spaces, there remains a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding the specific mechanisms underlying their influence on health and social outcomes. As a result, there is a noticeable gap in research exploring the differential impacts of green spaces on diverse demographic groups, including disparities related to socio-economic status, race, and age, like the community of Lahore. Addressing these research gaps is necessary for enhancing and expanding the management of green spaces and informing more equitable and effective urban planning and policy decisions. This study aims to close this gap in current scholarly work and available data by analyzing green spaces' services for communal social well-being and overall life satisfaction in Lahore.",

The study has consistently shown a positive association between access to green spaces in Lahore and social well-being. It has been concluded that residents with access to parks, gardens, and other natural areas within their neighbourhoods experience more activity within the community and are satisfied with their lives. These positive social impacts can be attributed to the unique affordances offered by green spaces. The green spaces of Lahore found vibrant social hubs, providing platforms for residents to interact and engage in shared activities. The presence of green areas and nature-based elements within the study area creates a welcoming atmosphere that contributes to a stronger sense of belonging and social cohesion within the community.\n\nSimilarly, exposure to green spaces has been linked to increased life satisfaction among urban residents. So, communal  well-being is associated with green spaces in Lahore, which necessitates their prioritization within urban planning strategies. By integrating and maintaining a network of green spaces throughout cities, planners can create environments that promote physical health and foster a sense of community, social interaction, and, ultimately, greater life satisfaction for residents. Therefore, active involvement and expansion of green spaces are recommended for communal well-being. It is essential to involve all stakeholders in planning and managing the urban parks and green areas because they meet the diverse needs of the communities. It is necessary to ensure everyone has equal access to these spaces and are well-maintained. Communities should develop specific plans and policies reinforced by solid evidence, focusing on equity and environmental justice. The community must also investigate how green spaces impact climate change and collaborate with health experts and decision-makers to consider such factors. Awareness about the advantages of green spaces can help inform research and decisions that consider why they are essential and how to enjoy their services sustainably and responsibly. It can be further recommended that different cities and cultures be compared globally to inform best practices for community happiness and health. Active community involvement and addressing disparities in resource distribution to ensure equitable access are ultimately critical in maintaining and reaping the positive impacts of green spaces."
