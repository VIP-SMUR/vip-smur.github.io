Most existing research on the psychological effects of urban environments is predominantly based on subjective self-report measures, which provide valuable insights into subjective experiences, but are also affected by conscious and subconscious bias. In the current study, we evaluate a multimodal approach to capturing wellbeing by employing objective mobile physiological and neurophysiological measurement technologies alongside self-reports to capture the impact of two different urban environments. Moreover, we endeavoured to comprehensively measure and, when possible, control the physical aspects of the environment. Our study specifically aimed to discover differences between psychological wellbeing indicators in adults across low-density vs. moderate-density urban environments. Data collection took place in two urban outdoor locations in Australia. Statistical comparison of the two locations indicated that low urban density led to comparatively higher levels of psychological wellbeing compared to moderate urban density. Self-reports indicated that the low-density environment led to higher levels of subjective feelings of comfort and safety and reduced levels of negative mood. In line with the subjective reports, in the low-density environment compared to the moderate-density environment, individuals showed higher levels of EEG theta activity, while EEG beta and heart rate measures were lower. The research outcome provides insights into how urban density affects people's wellbeing and showcases the benefits of employing ecologically-valid multimodal psychological-environmental measurement approaches to effectively evaluate the psychological impacts of built environments.",
        "5": " . \n\nThe world's urban population is expected to increase by  by , which will have significant impacts on the physical environment . The ecological and economic benefits of denser urbanisation are undisputed, but there are also challenges for human psychological wellbeing, i.e. general mood, the presence of stress, and feelings of comfort and security . However, so far, urban development planning has mainly considered functional and cost-effective factors .\n\nUrban density has been associated with an increased risk of health issues, such as sleep disturbance, asthma, and allergies . Furthermore, studies have reported higher rates of anxiety, depression, and mood disorders in urban areas compared to rural areas . More specifically, Kn√∂ll et al.  found that net building density  was positively associated with urban stress, leading to feelings of insecurity.\nPrevious research, focused on comparing dense city environments with rural areas, found that more physical space and green areas tend to elicit fewer adverse effects regarding psychological wellbeing, thus fostering higher levels of overall quality of life as compared to dense urban areas . In contrast, Berlyne's  psychological arousal theory suggests that environmental complexity stimulates pleasant feelings and sparks people's interest. Therefore, an optimal balance between simplicity and complexity needs to be present for an individual to gain hedonic value  from an environment; environments that are either too complex or too simple can promote stress and mental fatigue.\n\nIn keeping with theories that advocate for people's affinity for balanced stimuli, Kaplan's  attention restoration theory  suggests that the sensory stimuli of natural green space decrease levels of stress, as individuals do not need to continuously process busy, irrelevant stimuli; hence, they feel more relaxed. Similarly, Ulrich et al.'s . stress reduction theory  suggests that being in a natural environment increases positive emotions  while decreasing negative emotions  by reducing physiological stress responses  and promoting wellbeing.\n\nProlonged stress can have adverse effects on individuals' psychological wellbeing and thus worsen many mental health problems . Existing research on psychological effects of urban environments has mainly focused on comparing dense city environments with green areas  and predominantly includes subjective reports . Therefore, there is a gap in the research and a lack of understanding of how variations in urban density impact people's psychological wellbeing, which the current study aims to address.\n\nThe specific question for the current project was whether there any significant differences between subjective  and objective  indicators of psychological wellbeing in adults across urban environments with 'low' and 'moderate' building density.\n\nWe predicted that subjective indicators of psychological wellbeing would differ significantly across 'moderate'- and 'low'-density environments. Specifically, we predicted that self-reported psychological comfort, physiological comfort, and safety would be higher in a low-density environment as compared to a moderate-density environment. Additionally, it was predicted that participants would report higher positive mood and lower negative mood in the low-density environment as compared to the moderate-density environment. Moreover, we predicted that physiological indicators of psychological wellbeing would differ significantly across low- and moderate-density environments. Specifically, it was predicted that heart rate would be higher in the moderate-density environment as compared to the low-density environment. Regarding EEG activity, it was predicted that beta frequency power would be lower and theta frequency power would be higher in the low-density environment as compared to the moderate-density environment.\n\nNote: Panoramic image of the  low building-density environment and  moderate-density environment.",

The study included one independent variable: an urban built environment with two within-subject conditions . Three dependent variables were chosen for the study to obtain both subjective and objective measures of psychological wellbeing. The first was subjective comfort, operationalised by aggregated scores on psychological comfort, physiological comfort and safety questions from the self-administered six-item questionnaire. The second outcome variable was subjective mood , operationalised by scores on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule . The third dependent measure was physiological arousal as a marker of psychological wellbeing, operationalised by recorded heart rate data and global neural EEG  resting state data. As described above and in line with previous research, several environmental control variables were also recorded that could potentially affect wellbeing , i.e. humidity, temperature and sound pressure.",

The low-density area was a 'less compact' city area and the moderate-density environment was 'more compact'.

Therefore, to allow for greater consistency and comparability, the decision was made to use the more conservative, non-parametric Mann-Whitney  test for all measures . Only acoustic noise was significantly different across locations . Importantly though, noise effects were already educed, if not eliminated, for the human observer by wearing noise-cancelling earplugs to reduce the differential effects of noise between locations .

        "27": " .\n\nThe present study investigated psychological wellbeing across urban environments by utilising subjective and objective measurement tools. More specifically, it was hypothesised that both subjective indicators and physiological indicators of psychological wellbeing would significantly differ across 'moderate-density' and 'low-density' environments. The  of this study partly support the hypotheses.\n\nAs predicted, participants reported higher levels of psychological and physiological comfort as well as safety in the 'low-density' environment, as measured by the comfort and safety questionnaire. Existing research does not always clarify whether potential confounding environmental variables were assessed . Therefore, to ensure the robustness of the current study, temperature, humidity, and noise were either measured or experimentally controlled for . Taken together, the current study  indicate that participants' self-reported experience was affected by the density of the built environment rather than environmental factors.\n\nOur findings are in line with previous research, which also reported associations of higher density of buildings with perceived urban stress . One explanation is that building density tends to decrease open space in inner cities, which hinders traffic flow and increases areas of high vehicle congestion, which pedestrians perceive as unsafe . This suggests that perceiving an environment as unsafe could lead to increased subjective stress and psychological discomfort.\n\nSecondly, participants' heart rates were found to be significantly higher in the 'moderate-density' as compared to the 'low-density' environment. These  suggest that individuals were in a less aroused, more relaxed state within the 'low-density' condition while experiencing higher levels of arousal in the 'moderate-density' condition. This is in line with research finding that psychological states  that elicit short-term stress response and arousal manifest themselves in physiological changes . However, when considering the self-report , where participants experienced higher levels of security and psychological comfort as well as physiological comfort in the 'low-density' environment, it is indicated that the higher heart rate in the 'moderate-density' environment is caused by higher levels of distress rather than positive emotions .\n\nFurther, as hypothesised, participants displayed lower levels of beta frequency power and higher levels of theta frequency power in the 'low-density' as compared to the 'moderate-density' environment. In reference to earlier literature, these  indicate that individuals exhibited less physiological arousal and more relaxation in the 'low-density' condition . The predominant theta activity in the 'low-density' environment suggests that participants were in an awake, relaxed state , while the predominant beta activity in the 'moderate-density' environment implies that participants had to increase their cognitive demand due to increased thinking and information processing. Increased beta activity is also suggestive of increased vigilance . Considering that participants reported feeling less secure in the 'moderate-density' environment, beta activity may have increased as a function of vigilance and increased demand for attention . Further support is provided by Berlyne's psychological arousal theory, which states that an optimal balance between complexity and simplicity induces pleasant feelings . Here, findings show that individuals had less cognitive demand due to decreased information processing and, thus, arousal in the 'low density' environment. In turn, this suggests that the 'low-density' environment was closer to an optimal balance between complex and simple stimuli as compared to the 'moderate-density' condition. Finally, although this was not a dedicated hypothesis of this paper, as predicted, findings from also showed that participants displayed similar levels of alpha frequency power across both environments, demonstrating that the predominant factor explaining alpha activity was that participants had their eyelids closed in both conditions .\n\nIn regard to self-rated mood , participants reported significantly lower levels of negative affect in the 'low density' environment but indicated no meaningful difference in levels of positive affect across both environments. While these findings only partially support our prediction, it is still a notable finding, as individuals' levels of positive mood did not appear to be influenced by the environment. This could indicate that the short duration of presence at the location might not have been enough to\naffect positive mood or that the 'low-density' environment lacked some qualities that could lead to such an increase. Nevertheless, participants' levels of negative mood were affected by urban density, showing lower levels of negative mood in less dense environments. This finding is supported by Berlyne's  psychological arousal theory, which stipulates that stimulation within an environment is good, yet too much or too little of it can be harmful by causing increased levels of stress and mental fatigue. Here, the 'low-density' environment may have been the right balance between stimuli, while the 'moderate-density' environment may have been less balanced, thus inducing higher levels of negative mood. Emotional arousal and degree of attention activation are also important in the association between stimulus and cognitive response, as these control the selection, organisation, and execution of a stress response  ).\n\nFurther, considering literature from Lazarus and Folkman , which specifies that psychological distress is dependent on the subjective interpretation of a perceived environment, whether it elicits positive or negative emotions depending on how demanding the experience is, it becomes clear that the balance between too much and too little stimulation and complexity is a subjective experience that can vary with people's preferences. Overall, these findings show a general preference towards low-density environments in the sample of participants while still indicating that moderate-density environments have a more adverse influence on psychological wellbeing.\n\nThe main strength of our study is that it does not rely on subjective or objective measures alone. Previous research has mostly used subjective assessments , which pose a challenge when analysing  systematically, as they commonly involve cognitive biases despite acceptable psychometric validation of instruments . However, by including objective measurements, the study was able to identify and assess valuable relationships between low-density and moderate-density urban environments and psychological wellbeing more comprehensively. This mixed-method design improved the validity and reliability of the findings and strengthened the ability to discuss causal inferences . For example, the measure of heart rate as the criterion for psychological wellbeing validates the self-reported measures on the comfort and safety questionnaire, as it addresses to what extent scores on the subjective scale agree with the objective measures. Moreover, we did our best to measure, balance, control and eliminate external factors such as temperature, humidity, and noise. It should be noted, though, that the complexity of real-life environments will never provide the high levels of experimental control and internal validity as simulations or laboratory environments. In addition, while the choice to eliminate, or at least reduce, the effects of noise controlled an important confound, it also reduced the ecological validity of the investigation. Similarly, our choice to collect EEG and data while participants had their eyes closed allowed us to measure the lasting emotional impact of the environments without the threat that visual occurrences could contaminate the EEG signals. However, the absence of visual information could have reduced the size of the emotional effect.\n\nAnother limitation of our study is that we assessed low to moderate density environments only. It will be necessary also to explore medium to high-density urban environments to determine the potential differences in stress impact. A more comprehensive assessment of different levels of urban density would also allow determining whether its relationship between psychological wellbeing is linear or nonlinear. Finally, our findings might be culturally specific, i.e. only apply to the Australian context. Therefore, capturing socioeconomic population characteristics may be needed to further extend this study's relevance to a wider range of contexts.\n\nThe current study has increased the diversity of the current body of research and contributed to a better understanding of how different urban environments impact psychological wellbeing. Even so, further research in this area, coupled with the current pace of newly developed mobile technology, will lead to even more all-encompassing, data-driven technological advancements suitable for recording brain signals or other physiological markers of stress and wellbeing in the field. More specifically, portable devices that capture multimodal data may hold the potential to better identify mental health risk factors and produce reliable data to improve individual health and public wellbeing. As a result, city planners and authorities can use these enhanced technologies in large-scale, real-time studies to create smart cities that sustain and promote human health. This will have great implications, as populations are growing, urban density is expanding, and green environments will ultimately become a luxury.",
        "28": " . \n\nTo conclude, we still do not know exactly how future urban growth will present in terms of spatial development in different parts of the world or its impact on human wellbeing and the environment. The objective of the current study was to identify any differences between urban environments as opposed to green vs. urban environments. The current study found meaningful differences between low- and moderate-density environments, using both subjective and objective psychological wellbeing indicators. As such, this paper contributes to new empirical insights and perspectives concerning how compact city environments impact individuals' wellbeing. It is important to point out that the current research  show that moderate-density environments are not necessarily unfavourable. In fact, we may speculate that they may even be preferred if they provide an optimal level of stimulation, which can enhance individuals' feelings of happiness, increase psychological wellbeing, and ultimately increase life satisfaction. Additionally, the experienced atmosphere of built environments depends on qualitative and quantitative elements. Taken together, the current study's findings suggest positive outcomes of urban density on psychological wellbeing. However, researchers and city developers should proceed with caution and consider how cities can optimise sustainability and human health and wellbeing. Individuals perceive lower degrees of urban density as less stressful. Moreover, our study shows that mobile physiological measurement technology provides reliable and ecologically valid indicators of psychological wellbeing. Our study also highlights that triangulation via objective and subjective measures provides broader information base and greater confidence for decision making."
