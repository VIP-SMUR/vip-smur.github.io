        "3": " \n\nThis paper assesses how subjective wellbeing is related to housing and neighbourhood characteristics, controlling for personal variables. The secondary data analysis was based on the English Housing Survey, : Housing Stock Data and the English Housing Survey: Fuel Poverty Dataset, , collected in the period April  to March  . Subjective wellbeing was measured with four variables - life satisfaction, the perception of things being worthwhile in life, feeling happy and feeling anxious - that were dichotomized into low and high wellbeing. Logistic regression analysis showed that personal variables are most strongly related to wellbeing but that both housing and neighbourhood variables are also significantly related to it. Finding it difficult to keep the living room warm, being in fuel poverty, and finding it difficult to meet heating costs were associated with lower wellbeing. Low area satisfaction and not feeling safe were also significantly associated with lower wellbeing. The effects of variables are not constant across all four wellbeing measures used which raises the question 'which wellbeing' should be addressed.  also showed that targeting householders with lowest wellbeing and hence in greatest need of wellbeing interventions based on publicly available data would be challenging. Finally, the research community needs to address methodological challenges around identifying the most appropriate covariates, defining wellbeing and considering the measurement of key variables.",
        "4": " . \n\nWellbeing is a difficult concept to define; whilst we all have an intuitive understanding of what wellbeing is, no unified definition exists . Subjective wellbeing refers to how people think and feel about their own wellbeing; objective wellbeing is based on assumptions made about human needs and is often assessed through measures of income, life expectancy and mortality . Health, mental health and wellbeing are related concepts; for example, the WHO states that \"Mental health is a state of well-being ...\" and \"Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\" . Being in good health matters greatly for wellbeing but wellbeing can also influence health . Given that in many countries, people spend about  of their time in various buildings such as offices, homes, factories, and schools , the built environment is likely to play a role in wellbeing.\n\nOne of the most frequently used surveys to measure wellbeing is the\n\nWarwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale that covers subjective wellbeing and psychological functioning; all items focus on positive mental health  User Guide . The General Health Questionnaire which assesses non-psychotic and minor psychiatric disorders  can be used for evaluation of subjective wellbeing .\n\nIn national surveys in the UK, wellbeing is usually measured with four items . Life satisfaction is considered as an evaluative approach, asking respondents to make a cognitive assessment of how their life is going overall. The question on things being worthwhile sits in the eudemonic approach. It draws on self-determination theory and measures e.g. people's sense of meaning and purpose in life, connections with family and friends, and whether they feel part of something bigger than themselves . The questions on happiness and anxiety reflect an affective component of wellbeing, assessing people's positive and negative emotional experiences over a short timeframe . These questions assess distinct aspects of personal well-being and should not be combined into one composite measure .\n\nIn this study, the focus is on subjective wellbeing, using the definition and items as defined by the Office for National Statistics . For the literature review, a somewhat fluid distinction is made between mental health and wellbeing as some of the literature discusses both concepts together.",
        "5": " .. \n\nA plethora of studies assessed an association between the physical environment and mental wellbeing and mental health; here, only findings from review studies are summarized with a focus on high-income countries  as these are most relevant to the research conducted for this paper. Review studies that only included children were not considered. The review published by  was included in the review by Clark et al.  and is hence not covered extra here.\n\nEvans  provided a detailed summary of direct and indirect effects of the physical environment on mental health. Regarding direct effects, evidence showed that high-rise housing impacts well-being of women with young children negatively, as does crowding in homes, noise and air pollution. The review states that a number of studies suggest that poor housing quality is associated with poor mental wellbeing; however, because of methodological issues, definite s cannot be drawn. Indirect effects are those where the physical environment influences mental health through changing psychosocial processes that then impact on mental health. Examples are personal control, social support, and restoration - e.g. an environment with green, open spaces can allow greater restoration which in turn impacts positively on mental health.\n\nClark et al.  defined mental health to cover psychological wellbeing, symptoms of psychological distress at a level insufficient for the diagnosis of a disorder, diagnoses of psychiatric illness and suicide. Identified studies were evaluated for their quality. Exposure to violence or crime in the neighbourhood was linked to poorer mental health, as was perceived neighbourhood disorder, e.g. vandalism, lack of facilities, vacant housing and litter. There was also evidence for an effect of chronic noise exposure on mental health, in particular in adults. Studies found little association between household density and mental health and household tenure and mental health. Evidence for an effect of housing quality on mental health was mixed with no longitudinal evidence, and the cross-sectional studies that did indicate an association had study design issues. Consistent evidence indicated that housing and neighbourhood regeneration was linked to improved mental health, and cross-sectional evidence indicated that access to green and open spaces was linked to improved mental health, though in studies with low response rates.\n\nCooper et al.  covered some areas not relevant to this paper, such educational settings, workplaces, and healthcare settings which are not considered here. Outcome variables were mental health, mental wellbeing and mental capital, which stands for someone's total cognitive and emotional resources. The researchers followed a 'snowball method' to identify relevant work. No rating of the quality of the studies had been made which makes it hard to understand where evidence was strong. The evidence on mental capital indicated that poor housing and poor condition of the neighbourhood have negative impacts. Moving to better housing and better environments can improve mental wellbeing. People in high-rise buildings, particularly on higher floor levels suffer greater mental health problems than those in low-rise developments, and detached housing is associated with good mental wellbeing. High-density living, noise overcrowding, mould, damp, too cold or too hot temperatures have negative impacts on wellbeing.\n\nMoore et al.  restricted their review to\nrandomised  randomised controlled trials and controlled before-and-after studies of changes to the built environment. Of the  identified studies, only four were considered to contain robust data. The authors indicated that overall evidence was weak that built environment interventions improve mental health and quality-of-life estimates. There was no evidence that urban regeneration and green infrastructure improvements impacted on mental health. Some evidence indicated that changes in green infrastructure improved quality-of-life and reduced self-isolation.\n\nKrefis et al.  restricted their review to European and North American cities to be able to categorize impact factors into a model of urban wellbeing and health for the global North . Individual housing factors were not considered in this review. Whilst bias in the review as such was considered, individual studies were not systematically assessed for quality and bias. The authors indicate that most evidence suggested a link between access to green spaces and positive health and wellbeing outcomes.\n\nHunter et al.  conducted a review on urban greenspace interventions. Quality and bias in the evaluated evidence was assessed. Strong evidence exists that the greening of vacant lots improves wellbeing, e.g. through stress reduction; it also has positive social outcomes, e.g. reduction in crime and greater perceived safety which in turn likely impact on wellbeing.\n\nSingh et al.  focused exclusively on how housing disadvantage impacts on mental health in temporally ordered studies where the exposure to housing disadvantage preceded mental health measures. All  reviewed studies, of which five were judged as high quality, showed some relationship between housing disadvantage and mental health. Substandard housing quality was shown to be linked to higher stress levels, anxiety was higher in renters than owners; overcrowding was linked to a measure of mean depressive symptoms but not a depressive disorder. Ige et al.  focused on the link between buildings and physical health but reported that relocation to low-poverty areas was associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and that fabric improvements were related to mental health though through complex temporal relationships .\n\nIn summary, the reviews considered varied in important aspects; some focused only housing and neighbourhood factors; others only on urban factors ; one review only on housing disadvantage ; only some reviews assessed the quality of the underlying studies ; and the outcome measures considered varied substantially. Overall, the evidence seems to indicate that there is a link between urban greenspace and wellbeing outcomes; but conflicting findings on the effect of urban regeneration. Whilst cross-sectional studies suggest a link between housing quality and mental health, there was only scarce longitudinal evidence . What unites all reviews is the call for more and better studies in this field, particularly those that allow drawing causal s, have large samples and that control for confounders.",
        "6": " .. Outline of this study\n\nThis study analyses cross-sectional data, i.e. it cannot contribute to the much-needed longitudinal work. However, it uses a large sample with participants drawn from the English population  and so overcomes the issue of small, select samples. It includes a very wide range of variables, spanning personal, housing and neighbourhood level factors. Controlling for personal variables is essential in isolating built environment variables. Most factors discussed in previous reviews were included in some form, with the exception of data on regeneration schemes and green spaces as they were not present in the data . It uses four wellbeing measures that allow studying of different facets of wellbeing. What further sets our work apart, is a focus on variables related to being able to keep a dwelling warm/being fuel poor that have received little attention in\nprevious studies.\nFinally, the study follows good research practices around open, reproducible science - the work was preregistered , the code is made available , and the RECORD reporting guideline  is followed . The data cannot be shared by the authors but is accessible on a public database. Details on those practices are given in the attached checklist .",

        "8": " .. \n\nThis study uses data from the English Housing Survey . The EHS is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government . It collects information about people's housing circumstances and the condition of housing in England. It consists of:  a household interview , and  a physical inspection of a subsample of the properties through a surveyor . The addresses for the initial EHS sample are selected through a systematic random sample design. The response rate for the interview was . For the physical survey, a disproportionate number of social housing renters is included to ensure a large enough sample size . Since in this study, the interest is not in the state of national wellbeing but rather relationships between wellbeing and other variables, no survey weights have been applied.\n\nDatasets included in the analysis for this study were the English Housing Survey, : Housing Stock Data  and the English Housing Survey: Fuel Poverty Dataset,  . These data cover the period April  to March . The files contain the paired sample primary 'raw' interview survey and physical survey data plus associated derived variables for all cases where a physical survey has been completed. All data are available on the UK Data Archive, a national data service that provides research access to a range of social and economic data collections .",
        "9": " .. \n\nData sets varied in number of answers . Some physical survey data had been collected in vacant dwellings; for those there is no corresponding interview data. For other questions, data from all household members was collected; we only use self-reported data from the household reference person  who is defined as 'The person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation. In the case of joint owners and tenants, the person with the highest income is taken as the HRP. Where incomes are equal, the older is taken as the HRP.' .\n\nThe first step consisted of identifying for which respondents data was available in all relevant data files. Note that the files \"owner ...\" and \"renter ...\" only had data for some respondents depending on their tenure; they were merged to create a new variable with answers for all N  respondents . Other  respondents were excluded because of missing data on the wellbeing measures  or two predictors for which there was no logical way of merging the missing data with other response categories .

The majority of variables were used as given by the EHS but three variables need to be developed for the analysis . The first one is a variable indicating difficulty to pay mortgage or rent. The second variable is developed following a factor analysis on the variables indicating problems in the local area indicated by a surveyor. The third variable was a scale on \"feeling of safety\" based on the variables that measure perceived safety in the home, in the neighbourhood during the day, and the neighbourhood during night. In order to show the frequencies of all predictor variables together, descriptive information has been placed in the  section . Appendix C shows all variables and which EHS datafile they were derived from.",
        "13": " .. \n\nAs per prespecification, ordinary Least Squares Regression Analysis would have been conducted if assumptions for it were met; since that was not the case , logistic regression was used with the outcome variable dichotomized into lower and higher wellbeing. A separate analysis is conducted for each wellbeing measures, with the predictors being the same across all our regression models. The following hypotheses are tested for each wellbeing variable:\nA. Wellbeing is lower for occupants in dwellings with worse Energy Performance Certificate  ratings. \nB. Wellbeing is highest for occupants in detached homes and lowest in high-rise flats.\nC. Wellbeing is lower for occupants who find it difficult to meet their heating/fuel costs.\nD. Wellbeing is lower for occupants in fuel poverty  definition.\nE.

A dichotomy was created instead of using the four possible outcome categories of low, medium, high and very high, given the paucity of data points for low wellbeing . There is debate on whether dichotomizing continuous data is adequate (Kuss, ; Maccallum et al., ;\n\nSnijders, Bosker, \\& Roel, ); however, given that ONS presents the variables routinely as categories and the ease of interpretation of a logistic regression compared to multiple transformed variables, we proceeded with logistic regression.

        "23": " .. Variables to target wellbeing initiatives\n\nThe analysis up to this point showed that various variables can explain variation in wellbeing measures, in particular those based on self-report of householders. Whilst these findings can grow our understanding of relationships between built environment and wellbeing, they would not necessarily help in targeting households most likely to experience low wellbeing as many of the variables are not observable from the outside. Hence, in a final part of the analysis , we identified how well existing data can be used for targeting wellbeing interventions. The first model encompasses EPC data which is publicly available and includes the EPC rating, floor area and dwelling type for a dwelling. The second model consists of Index of Multiple Deprivation , the Government Office region and the morphology. These data exist on an area basis and apply to any dwelling in that area. The third model consists of the census data which exists on a per-dwelling resolution but is not made publicly available but in theory could be used for analysis and targeting. The variables for this model are: \"GeneralHealth\", \"MaritalStatus\", \"HighestQual\", \"AgeHRP\", \"SexHRP\", \"EmploymentHRP\", \"Househ_Type\", \"EthnicityHRP\", \"Tenure\", \"BedroomStandard\". Fig.  shows how well the models perform to explain variation in Life Satisfaction .\n\nAdding model  and model  add significantly to the previous models ;  Tjur  for the EPC model, . for the area model,\n\nand . when adding census data.\nThe analysis also shows that the effect of a predictor varies depending on which other factors are included.

The  indicate that across all outcome measures, personal variables play the greatest role for wellbeing. Both housing and neighbourhood variables increase the amount of explained variance but overall, only a modest amount of variance is explained. Hypotheses on lower wellbeing when having greater difficulty in meeting fuel cost, being unable to keep the living room warm, being in fuel poverty  were largely supported . For neighbourhood variables, lower satisfaction and lower perceived safety were associated with lower wellbeing.\n\nThe findings add to an existing body of literature on the link between\nthe built environment and mental health. However, to our knowledge this was the first study to systematically link built environment and wellbeing as measured by the four questions of the Office for National Statistics.\n\nPrevious reviews had indicated conflicting evidence on the link between housing quality and mental health . A detailed look at the underlying studies shows substantial heterogeneity in how the outcome variable was operationalized and how housing quality was defined. Blair  reported a link of an objective marker of stress, i.e. cortisol level and a composite definition of housing quality. Curl et al.  showed that fabric improvements had positive mental health outcomes. However, Evans  and Clark et al.  judge there to be insufficient evidence to assume a causal relationship. Using a very different mental health indicator, here, self-reported wellbeing, we also showed a link to housing quality in terms of being able to keep the home warm, including the financial affordability, but only through cross-sectional data. Experiencing damp was also liked to lower wellbeing though not for all operationalizations of wellbeing.\n\nDissatisfaction with the local environment and feeling very unsafe were strongly linked to lower wellbeing in our study, in line with\nOverview of the hypotheses and whether they were confirmed for the different outcome variables. .\n\n\n Tjur for the four outcome variables across the three models.\n\n\nprevious reports ; however, it is worth pointing out that surveyor assessed conditions of the local environment were not clearly related to wellbeing .\n\nBeing in arrears with rent or mortgage payment showed a link to life satisfaction only; Alley et al.  had reported a link to depressive symptoms in a sample limited to Americans over  years.\n\nPrivate renters living in unfurnished homes experienced greater anxiety; similar to what Kang et al.  reported generally for renters; though here respondents who lived in social housing or rented privately but furnished did not show a significant association and Kang's study only looked at older citizens.\n\nOvercrowding did not have a significant link to wellbeing in our study whereas e.g. Sadowski et al.  reported such an effect; however, they looked at experience of overcrowding in early childhood and its effect on later life whereas our study is cross-sectional.\n\nIn summary, our study supports a range of existing findings and adds evidence on a new conceptualization around being able to keep the home warm; however, as discussed in .. there are a number of methodological challenges that limit comparability of different studies.",
        "25": " .. Policy implications\n\nThis paper highlights that targeting householders based on readily observable characteristics is not an easy task. Given the strong relationship between health and wellbeing  targeting via medical records might be the most promising avenue; however, only for those who sought treatment for a medical condition. When not controlling for other factors, smaller dwellings and a lower IMD are associated with lower wellbeing. Wellbeing was highest in detached dwellings. Hence, those variables might be the most suitable for targeting wellbeing interventions in the absence of other information. However, it needs to be emphasized that these variables largely lost their significant association when controlling for other variables which is irrelevant for targeting purposes but indicates careful consideration needs to be given as to what underlies lower wellbeing.\n\nThe  also highlight that wellbeing is correlated with personal, building, and neighbourhood variables. Focusing only on one of those areas will hence be limited in how much it can change wellbeing.\n\nFinally, the study showed that variables around homes being financially difficult to heat and keep warm were highly significant predictors. Previous work has linked cold homes to negative health outcomes . Fuel poverty is here shown to correlate negatively with wellbeing, supporting the established connection between fuel poverty and mental health . Interestingly, only the  definition, i.e. when a household is unable to obtain adequate energy services for  of its income , showed this significant association. The later low income-high costs definition in which a household is seen as fuel poor if it has required fuel costs that are above the national median average and the household would be left with an income below poverty line if it spent that amount on fuel , had no significant effect. Fuel poverty is a complex issue . How to best define it is beyond the scope of the paper; however, it is crucial to note that different definitions identify different households as fuel-poor and hence to avoid generic statements about the effect of fuel poverty.",
        "26": " .. Methodological implications\n\nThree important methodological considerations are highlighted by this study.\na)  differ depending on what covariates are being included, and currently, there is no clear guidance on which ones to include. This is problematic if s differ substantially depending on which other variates are included in analyses. A prominent example from this study is dwelling type. Controlling for other variables, dwelling type has no significant effect on wellbeing; however, in the model with fewer covariates it does and previous research has also indicated a role of dwelling type . Greater focus on theoretical models to underpin links between the built environment and wellbeing would help in choosing appropriate covariates.\n\nb) The same variables are differently associated with different wellbeing measures. As the ONS states, the four measures reflect different facets of wellbeing. Hence to find that different factors are differentially associated is congruent with this view. However, it raises the issue that if we want to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relationship of the built environment and wellbeing with the aim of\nintervening to improve wellbeing, we need to be clear on what wellbeing is and which of its multifaceted aspects is to be addressed. This study focused on subjective wellbeing, i.e. a person's evaluation of their personal situation; however, objective approaches to measuring wellbeing exist such as using GDP or composite indicators encompassing health, job opportunities, socioeconomic\n of model comparison.\n\n\ndevelopment, environment, safety, and politics . This raises further complexity around the relationship between the two, with subjective wellbeing focused on personal experience and objective measures on societal wellbeing. Linking built environmental measures to objective wellbeing will necessarily lose granularity of findings as not the : relationship of a person and dwelling is assessed.\nc) Overall understanding of what predicts wellbeing is low. This study did not control for all variables shown to play a role in earlier studies  which might partly explain this overall low understanding. However, it also raises the question if important predictors are overlooked, such as personality . It is also possible that some important variables of the built environment have not been included or measured suboptimally. For example, this study has only included proxies for outdoor air pollution. Measuring pollutants might help to explain more variance in wellbeing. Also, overcrowding was assessed using an official indicator and not through subjective perception which might be more relevant .",
        "27": " .. Limitations and future research\n\nThis study was cross-sectional in nature and can only show correlational evidence. Future research on causal relationships between the built environment and wellbeing is needed as stated previously .\n\nSome variables that might have an impact on wellbeing were not available for this study, such as neighbourhood violence  or access to recreational spaces . Furthermore, the study had a relatively narrow focus on housing conditions in high-income countries; also in the literature review, evidence e.g. around housing in slums was not considered and the findings cannot contribute to the rich body of literature in that field .\n\nThis study relied on self-report and surveyor assessment but did not include measured parameters such as temperatures in dwellings, noise or air pollution which might be important  and should be included in future research.\n\nThe data was based on a large national survey. Since rented properties were oversampled, the wellbeing data is not fully nationally representative; however, as shown in ., the average wellbeing ratings in this study were very similar to a fully representative sample. Additionally,  on the links between predictors and wellbeing should be generalizable to other households in England with the same characteristics, given the underlying sample size and initial sampling strategy . However, the longevity of  is unclear; especially the experience of the Covid- pandemic can have substantially altered the relationship between the built environment and subjective wellbeing.",
        "28": " . \n\nThis study based on a large sample size showed that personal, housing and neighbourhood factors are all correlated with subjective wellbeing which highlights the need to focus on multiple aspects to promote well-being. It also showed that targeting householders with lowest wellbeing based on publicly available data would be challenging.\n\nThe effects of variables are not constant across all four wellbeing measures used which raises the question 'which wellbeing' should be addressed. Finding it difficult to keep the living room warm, being in fuel poverty and struggling with meeting fuel costs were the housing variables most consistently associated with lower wellbeing. Low area satisfaction and low perceived safety were neighbourhood variables associated with lower wellbeing. Finally, the research community needs to address methodological challenges around identifying the most appropriate covariates, defining wellbeing and considering the measurement of key variables."
