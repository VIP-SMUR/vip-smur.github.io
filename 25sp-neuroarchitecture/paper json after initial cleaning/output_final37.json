We explored the longitudinal association between change to the neighbourhood built environment and the wellbeing of local residents in deprived areas of Glasgow, Scotland.\n: A cohort of residents  responded to a postal survey in  and . Wellbeing was assessed with the mental  and physical  components of the SF- scale. We developed software to aid identification of visible changes in satellite imagery occurring over time. We then used a Geographical Information System to calculate the percentage change in the built environment occurring within an  m buffer of each participant's home.\n: The median change in the neighbourhood built environment was \\% . In the whole sample, physical wellbeing declined by . units on average, and mental wellbeing increased by . units, over time. In multivariable linear regression analyses, participants living in neighbourhoods with a greater amount of change in the built environment  experienced significantly reduced physical  and mental  wellbeing over time compared to those living in neighbourhoods with less change. For mental wellbeing, a significant interaction by baseline perception of financial strain indicated a larger reduction in those experiencing greater financial strain . However, this relationship was reversed in those experiencing lower financial strain, whereby living in neighbourhoods with a greater amount of change was associated with significantly improved mental wellbeing over time .\ns: Overall, we found some evidence that living in neighbourhoods experiencing higher levels of physical change worsened wellbeing in local residents. However, we found a stronger negative relationship in those with lower financial security and a positive relationship in those with higher financial security.

        "3": " \n\nThe majority of the world's population now live in urban areas, with the proportion projected to increase to two thirds of the population by  . An accumulating body of work indicates that the urban neighbourhood can influence the physical, social and mental wellbeing of residents and communities . Together, this suggests that urban design has a key role to play in supporting population health in the future .\n\nHowever, substantial inequalities in health exist between the least and most deprived neighbourhoods in cities . It has been proposed that in deprived neighbourhoods, multiple features of the physical environment   could compound to exacerbate health inequalities - a concept termed 'deprivation amplification' . The relationship between deprivation and ill health is not straightforward and appears to interact with a complex arrangement of individual and ecological factors . For example, efforts to tease out the relative contributions of area- and individual-level socioeconomic circumstances on heath suggest that low socio-economic status individuals living in deprived areas tend to have the worst health outcomes , whereas higher socio-economic status can buffer individuals from the negative effects of living in deprived areas .\n\nUrban renewal or regeneration can take many forms, but is often associated with changes to the physical built environment. This includes activities such as the creation or removal of parks, the construction of community centres, and upgrades or repairs to properties or streets, as well as the demolition of existing housing stock or other community amenities. Urban renewal is proposed as one way to target the wider physical, social and economic determinants of ill health in deprived communities . Some evidence suggests that urban renewal can promote modest improvements in health and wellbeing , and reduce, or at least not exacerbate, health inequalities . However, the evidence base is far from conclusive.\n\nPreviously we demonstrated that exposure to one specific type of major change to the urban environment  was associated with detrimental changes to wellbeing in local residents . Prior to its construction, the motorway was described by supporters as both a component of, and a catalyst for, urban renewal . Here, we consider general change occurring in the built environment, and explore the feasibility of using a novel and simple method to quantify the degree of change occurring over time . Our specific aims were to:  examine the longitudinal association between exposure\nto general change in the neighbourhood built environment and change in wellbeing;  explore whether this relationship differed in population sub-groups; and  explore whether this relationship differed in those additionally exposed to a specific change in the built environment, a new urban motorway, not captured by the primary exposure measure.",

The analyses reported here are part of a larger mixed-method natural experimental study examining the effects of a new urban motorway on travel, physical activity, road traffic accidents and wellbeing in local communities.

        "7": " \n\nThe overall study aimed to examine how living near an urban motorway affected activity and health outcomes. At baseline we delineated three study areas in Glasgow using a Geographic Information System . Using spatially referenced census data combined with field visits, we created study areas which were broadly comparable on key socioeconomic  and topographic  factors . The three areas differed by proximity to a motorway; the South study area contained a new motorway , the East study area contained an existing motorway  and the North study area contained a railway segment but no motorway infrastructure .\n\nBecause of the comparability of the three areas, and because we found no baseline sociodemographic differences by study area , for the purpose of this analysis we combined the three study areas.",
        "8": " \n\nAt baseline in , we recruited an initial sample of adults aged  years or over using a postal survey\n\ndelivered to a random sample of private residential addresses in each of the three study areas. The sample was drawn from the Royal Mail Postcode Address File and  surveys in total were mailed . Participants were informed that return of the survey constituted consent to participate in the study. Respondents were also given the option to consent to future contact, and yearly contact  was maintained with those who agreed. At follow-up in , those who could still be contacted were mailed another survey. While those who were known to have moved out of the study areas  or Glasgow  were followed up if they remained in the UK, they were removed for the purpose of this analysis as we could not generate an exposure measure for these individuals.\n\nTo maximise our response and buffer against likely attrition over the  year follow-up period, we followed recommendations for the use of postal surveys  including sending notification postcards prior to the main survey, following up non-response, and offering a small monetary incentive . At both time points, the survey was mailed in October and staggered across multiple days, and responses received more than  months after the first mailing were disregarded.",

Items were scored on or -point Likert scales, with physical and mental component summary scores  then derived using standard procedures . Higher scores on these scales reflect greater wellbeing. The SF- has been extensively validated and shown to be sensitive to change in the health status of the individual . The scale is highly correlated with the original  item version   which has been shown to\nhave associations with job loss, primary care utilisation and five-year survival .",
        "11": " \n\nAt both baseline and follow-up, participants reported their age in years, sex, housing tenure, number of cars owned, working status, perceived financial strain, whether they had a chronic condition and years lived in the local area. For the purpose of analysis, housing tenure was dichotomised as owner-occupier versus other, car ownership as not owning a car versus owning at least one car and working status as working or studying versus other. Perceived financial strain was assessed with the following item: \"Thinking about the cost of living as it affects you and your household, which of these best describes your situation at present?\" The response options were: \"Find it a strain to get by from week to week\"; \"Have to be careful about money\"; \"Able to manage without much difficulty\"; and \"Quite comfortably off\". For the purpose of analysis, this was dichotomised as more strain  or less strain .",
        "12": " Exposure to change in the neighbourhood built environment\n\nWe wished to quantify the degree of physical change occurring in participants' local area over the course of the study, in order to investigate how exposure to such change was related to wellbeing. However, the UK does not have off-the-shelf data with which to describe built environment change over time. Current and historical satellite imagery is freely available and covers most of the globe, including the study areas. Therefore, we explored the possibility of using Google Earth as a source of information on change to the built environment over time. This complements work by others using Google products such as Street View to explore aspects of the built environment .\nWe developed bespoke software to display side-by-side Google Earth satellite images of the same location taken at different times, using the time slider function. The software allowed the operator to zoom the images and move them in tandem, manually comparing the two frames with the aid of overlaid cross-hairs. Areas of change between  and  were identified, which included the construction or demolition of buildings and the loss or gain of green space . These areas were delineated with a polygon .\nUsing this software, we identified all visible changes occurring between  and  in each of the three study areas and extending to approximately  km beyond their boundaries . As expected, substantial changes had occurred in all three study areas. We did not characterise each change; we simply noted that change had occurred. This allowed us to explore the impacts of change per se regardless of the associated value\n\n\n\nof that change to local residents. For example, our exposure measure included both gain and loss of green space, and both building and demolition, all of which were coded as change. Furthermore, we did not identify the general  or specific  features of the identified changes. The carriageway of the new M motorway was not included, although we did include the demolition and construction of buildings and roads nearby.\nFollowing this, polygons were imported into a GIS , and the area in square metres of each polygon was calculated. Using each participant's home address, we then delineated their neighbourhood which we defined using an  m pedestrian network buffer around the weighted population centroid of the unit postcode, similar to definitions used in other recent studies . Finally, we identified the percentage of the area within each neighbourhood that had changed . This gave an indication of the general amount of change occurring in each individual's neighbourhood, whereby higher values represented a greater amount of change. A unit change in this exposure represented an increase of one percentage point. Examples of neighbourhoods experiencing different amounts of change can be found in Fig. .",
        "13": " \n\nDescriptive information on the longitudinal cohort was generated for baseline and follow-up characteristics. We explored changes over time, and differences between the longitudinal cohort and the remainder of the baseline sample lost to follow-up, using one-way analysis of variance , t and chi-squared tests.\nUsing linear regression models, we assessed the relationship of exposure to change in the neighbourhood built environment with change in  PCS- and  MCS-. Covariates that we hypothesised could confound the association between place of residence and wellbeing, and that have been considered in other similar research, were added in steps. Model  was unadjusted; model  was adjusted for age and sex; model  was adjusted for the variables in model  plus home ownership, car ownership, working status, perceived financial strain, presence of a chronic condition and years lived in the local area; and the maximally adjusted model  was adjusted for the variables in model  plus the baseline value of the outcome of the model in question . We did not impute data due to less than  missing values for all variables.\nFollowing this main analysis, we tested all maximally adjusted models for interactions with baseline perceived financial strain, presence of a chronic condition, and years lived in the local area, characteristics which we\n\nhypothesised could moderate this relationship. Additionally, we tested all maximally adjusted models for an interaction with study area  to examine whether the outcomes of exposure to general neighbourhood change differed in those additionally exposed to motorway infrastructure. If interaction terms were statistically significant, we ran stratified analyses to elucidate their interpretation, removing the stratification variable as a covariate but retaining all other covariates described above. For all analyses, we set the alpha at . .",

Stratified analysis indicated that in participants\nexperiencing greater financial strain, those living in neighbourhoods with a greater amount of change in the built environment experienced significantly reduced mental wellbeing over time compared to those living in neighbourhoods with less change , a slightly larger coefficient than that found in the main analysis. However, in participants experiencing less financial strain, those living in neighbourhoods with a greater amount of change in the built environment experienced significantly improved mental wellbeing over time compared to those living in neighbourhoods with less change , a reversal of the relationship found in the main analysis .\nTo test the robustness of this finding, we conducted a post-hoc analysis creating another binary variable indicating participants who had less financial strain at both time points  versus all other combinations . A statistically significant  interaction by this new variable was found, with the pattern of outcomes mirroring the moderation analysis described above.

However, this overall pattern of findings was not distributed uniformly; for mental wellbeing, there was a larger reduction among those reporting greater levels of financial strain. Financial security reversed the relationship, with higher levels of neighbourhood change associated with improvements in mental wellbeing in those reporting greater financial security. It may be that the purpose, drivers and nature of environmental changes fundamentally differ between wealthier and less wealthy neighbourhoods, explaining the associations we found. Finally, we found that the negative association between exposure to general change and mental wellbeing was heightened in those additionally exposed to another specific change in the built environment - the construction of a new motorway.",
        "23": " \n\nIn this proof of concept study, we devised a novel and simple method for identifying and quantifying the degree of physical environmental change by using satellite imagery in the public domain. This contributes to efforts in the field to 'longitudinalise' contextual information . In addition, we used an extensively validated tool to assess wellbeing. We then found novel, statistically significant associations between exposure to change in the neighbourhood built environment and individual-level change in wellbeing over time in a longitudinal cohort, which differed by socioeconomic status. This study contributes to an accumulating body of research on how changes to the built environment affect health and health inequalities .\n\nWe also acknowledge the study limitations. It is likely that self-selection bias occurred, and we make no claim that our sample were representative of the general local population. Initial response to the postal survey was low , and attrition of the cohort over  years was high , but comparable to other similar studies . In addition, our measure of neighbourhood environmental change was not validated, and because it was developed later in the project there was a slight mismatch between the study period  and the timescale of the satellite images . The use of  m buffers to define the neighbourhood is consistent with other studies, but research indicates that people roam considerably further in their daily lives . However, a gold-standard method of assessing neighbourhood environmental change does not exist. As such, this was an exercise in pragmatism to demonstrate the potential of using satellite imagery as one form of \"ragged evidence\" , to contribute to learning in the wider field of environmental interventions, and to set the scene for future research.\nOur assessment of total change was a simplified approach to understanding what is undoubtedly a complex relationship between the environment and health. In particular, the lack of specificity makes it difficult to identify causal mechanisms between exposure and outcome, as we were not able to characterise changes and therefore get a sense of which changes were 'positive' or 'negative'. The characterisation of changes identified from satellite imagery is therefore an important avenue for future research. However, this study was intended to be hypothesis generating rather than definitive, and our\nprevious research highlights some possible mechanisms, which are discussed further in Section .. Finally, the possibility of non-independent observations, unmeasured confounding and the specificity of findings to the context in which they occurred are core, but mostly unavoidable, limitations of research in this area.",
        "24": " \n\nParticipants living in neighbourhoods with a greater amount of change in the built environment experienced reduced physical  and mental  wellbeing over time compared to those living in neighbourhoods with less change. Although these coefficients may appear comparatively small, they represent estimates of the difference in wellbeing between participants living in neighbourhoods that differed in change by a single percentage point. It may be more meaningful to compare neighbourhoods that differ by a larger 'dose' of change, for example \\% or \\% . For these comparisons, the estimated differences in physical wellbeing are -. and -. PCS- units respectively, and for mental wellbeing are -. and -. MCS- units respectively. To place these changes in context, they are modest compared to previous clinical research in headache sufferers that observed a . unit  and . unit  reduction in patients experiencing reduced overall quality of life . However, our findings occurred in a non-clinical, community-based context, in which detrimental effects might accumulate over time.\n\nThe current study evaluated general change, and is not an assessment of the impacts of urban renewal. However, we highlight previous urban renewal research as both exposures incorporate elements of physical change. Previous studies have mostly found either no change or modest improvements in wellbeing following targeted urban renewal . In particular, another study conducted in Glasgow evaluating the impacts of neighbourhood demolition and renewal found a statistically significant increase in mental wellbeing in participants receiving housing improvements relative to controls, using the SF-, another derivation of the SF-  . In that study, physical deterioration and demolition of neighbourhoods did not appear to adversely affect residents' wellbeing , but specific types of housing improvements  had mostly positive impacts on mental wellbeing , and higher total monetary investment in renewal led to greater improvement in mental wellbeing over  years compared with lower investment  .\n\nPrevious research also suggests that urban renewal can narrow  existing inequalities in health or wellbeing between lower and higher\nsocioeconomic groups . Those renewal packages targeted specific improvements to the built environment and investment was allocated according to need. In our study, we examined general change to the built environment, and our findings were more similar to previous work suggesting that individuals from lower socioeconomic groups benefit less from interventions aimed at the general population , with the important distinction that in our study the changes were associated with a harmful trend in lower socioeconomic groups.",
        "25": " \n\nSeveral issues may be of interest to researchers in the field. Firstly, our exposure measure could be described as broad, or more pejoratively as crude. However, other researchers evaluating changes in the built environment have used similarly broad exposures, where the specific type of environmental change occurring was not captured . As described in Egan et al. , the use of a broad exposure may allow us to move beyond the 'form' of a particular environmental change to focus on the 'function' of that change , though we do not claim to have identified the specific function in this preliminary analysis.\n\nA related issue is the challenge of identifying plausible causal mechanisms by which these broad exposures may be related to increases or decreases in wellbeing. In our larger mixed-method study examining the impacts of living near a new urban motorway, qualitative research gave insights into the causal recipe by which exposure to a motorway was associated with reductions in wellbeing. This work suggested that noise and air pollution had contributed to worsening wellbeing in those living very close to the new road . In the current analysis, much of our neighbourhood change exposure was comprised of demolition or construction and thus it is plausible that similar mechanisms were involved. In addition, the qualitative study indicated that the social fabric of communities was also undergoing a rapid change, which many related to successive waves of immigration. In some cases, this had introduced a sense of fraying social cohesion in the community. Albeit conducted in only one of the three study areas that comprised the sample for the current analysis, these observations highlight the contribution of changes in both the physical and social environment, and suggests that both mechanisms could have been operating in the current study.",
        "26": " \n\nThere is currently little clear public health evidence about the impacts of targeted urban renewal, or more general changes to the built environment, to guide policy and planning. Change may bring new opportunities to neighbourhoods and communities, but it may be that\nindividuals require the financial resources to capitalise on these opportunities. For urban renewal specifically, some have suggested that this can increase the cost of living  and contribute to gentrification of the area , which might have negative impacts on those in an already financially precarious situation, and eventually lead to their displacement from the area. On the other hand, research suggests that some environments can narrow socioeconomic inequalities in health. Access to recreational or green areas is a key feature of these socalled 'equigenic' environments , though some suggest that improvements in access to urban green space can also accelerate gentrification .",
        "27": " \n\nWe found some evidence that living in neighbourhoods experiencing high levels of physical change worsened wellbeing in local residents. However, we found a stronger negative relationship in those with lower levels of financial security and a positive relationship in those with higher levels of financial security. This is one of few studies exploring the longitudinal relationship between the environment and health."
