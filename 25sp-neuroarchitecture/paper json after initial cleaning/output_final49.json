        "3": " \n\nRelatively little research has attempted to disentangle the individual and neighborhood conditions underlying health disparities. To address this, survey data were collected from , residents living in one of the  census tracts.  from a multilevel structural equation model found an individual's perceptions of the social and built environment were significantly associated with their current physical health, mental health, and perceived stress. Associations between household income and poor physical health were more pronounced for participants who lived in low-income neighborhoods compared to participants who lived in high-income neighborhoods. Additionally, Black residents reported significantly better mental health than White residents when they lived in high-income neighborhoods, while Black residents who lived in low-income neighborhoods reported significantly more stress than White residents in low-income neighborhoods.  of this study advance scientific understanding of social determinants of health and may aid in the development of programs and policies.",
        "4": "  | \n\nResearchers have begun to evaluate the ethical implications of persistent health disparities found between minority and majority populations . In particular, the role of social and built environments in the formation and maintenance of health disparities has gained increased attention . This shift in attention has occurred in part because research findings have consistently found residents from low socioeconomic neighborhoods were associated with higher prevalence rates of coronary heart disease , diabetes , obesity , mortality , and other health concerns, even after adjusting for individual-level income, education, and occupation.\n\nPrevious literature suggests that indicators of the neighborhood social environment such as social cohesion , social control , safety ,\nand violence  are all related to residents' health status. Thus, individuals may be directly affected by living in stressful neighborhoods, most likely due to an increased likelihood of exposure to chronic stressors.\n\nThe built environment of neighborhoods can also have a direct influence on residents' health. The presence of toxins, including lead paint, asbestos, and mold, has been shown to be associated with poorer health and well-being of both children and adults . In addition, the design of buildings and neighborhoods themselves can greatly influence the health of those that inhabit them. Access to walking trails , proximity to grocery stores that sell fresh foods , and the availability of nearby parks  are all associated with residents' health.",
        "5": " . \n\nResidents of the same neighborhood can also differ in their perception of shared neighborhood conditions. Research that measures residents' neighborhood perceptions has the potential benefit of enabling one to assess how individual residents differentially respond to the same neighborhood environment and experiences . Additionally, differences in residents perception of the same neighborhood may contribute to the presence of health disparities .\n\nPerceptions of the neighborhood environment have been found to vary depending on the ethnic or racial  of the independent observer. Some researchers have found that Black residents perceive their neighborhoods as less safe and less pleasant for engaging in physical activity than White residents , while others have found the opposite when controlling for socioeconomic status . Schulz et al.  found that White residents perceive higher levels of both social and physical environmental stress compared to African American residents of the same neighborhood. These findings suggest that even when individual income and education are held constant, residents of different ethnic s continue to differ in their perceptions of the same neighborhood.",
        "6": " . | Interactions of individual and neighborhood level research\n\nBecause of a greater awareness of the potential for interactions between individuals and their neighborhoods, researchers have begun to study why some residents have better health outcomes than others despite living in similar conditions. Previous research has clearly outlined many of the known associations between individual level SES and health , with the preponderance of these findings concluding that individuals of lower SES have higher prevalence rates of illness, greater severity of illness, and greater rates of mortality for most illnesses.\n\nMoreover, the relationship between individual-level SES and health outcomes has been found to exist on a gradient, such that for every step increase in SES, individuals may reap better health outcomes , and the amount of time one spends in a low SES demographic as a child, the higher his or her mortality rate as an adult . While these findings have assisted in understanding general associations between SES and health, few studies have examined the potential for interactions between individual and neighborhood characteristics on health .\n\nDespite the consistently positive associations between having greater individual wealth and better health outcomes overall, findings on the effects of living in a low-income versus a high-income neighborhood have been mixed. Some research suggests that simply living in a higher SES neighborhood is associated with better health outcomes for all residents ; however, other researchers have found either no effect  or interaction effects . For example, Winkleby  and colleagues found that the death rates of men and women with lower income and education were highest when they lived in high SES neighborhoods and lowest when they lived in low SES neighborhoods. Contrary to this, research by Boylan and Robert  found that low SES individuals who live in high SES neigh-\nborhoods have significantly better cardiovascular health than low SES individuals living in low SES neighborhoods .\n\nStudies have also found that neighborhood effects differ as a function of race, ethnicity, and culture. One study found that mortality rates were more strongly associated with neighborhood poverty for Black residents compared to White residents . Moreover, those authors found that Black residents had significantly higher rates of mortality in low-income neighborhoods compared to Black residents in higher income neighborhoods. This suggests that Black residents may be more susceptible than White residents to the detrimental influences associated with living in low-income neighborhoods. Researchers have speculated that greater exposure to discrimination and other social disadvantages may underlie Black residents' reports of worse health outcomes compared to White residents that live in comparable neighborhoods .\n\nResearch on immigrant populations has also highlighted the need for researchers to consider interactions between residents and their neighborhoods . Georgiades et al.  found that low SES neighborhoods had higher rates of children with emotional-behavioral problems and poorer school performance. However, this study also found that immigrant families reported fewer emotionalbehavioral problems if they lived in neighborhoods with high concentrations of other immigrant families, regardless of the overall level of neighborhood SES. In contrast, nonimmigrants fared worse when they lived in neighborhoods with high levels of immigrants than if they lived with fewer immigrants. This finding suggests that neighborhoods in which high proportions of residents share similar cultural s may heighten neighborhood cohesiveness, a quality that may be of particular importance for immigrant families.",
        "7": "  | \n\nResearch on health disparities has long focused on the extent and nature of the disparities between ethnic groups and social classes. Research is beginning to disentangle the interactive individual characteristics and neighborhood conditions underlying health outcomes and disparities . The current study seeks to better explain these associations by examining individual and contextual effects using a comprehensive multilevel model.\n\nA multilevel observational design was used to investigate main effects and interactions between individual- and neighborhood-level risk factors in relation to individual-level health status. We propose the following hypotheses:\n\nH: Residents with better perceptions of their neighborhood will report better health.\nH: Neighborhood characteristics including an environment conducive to walking, collective efficacy, and safety will be associated with better individual health status.\n\nH: The strength of the relationships between individual-level income and race/ethnicity, and individual health status will vary as a function of neighborhood-level income. Specifically,  we believe that individuals with low personal income who live in low-income neighborhoods will have worse health outcomes than low-income individuals who live in higher income neighborhoods and  Black residents who live in low-income neighborhoods will report worse health outcomes than Black residents who live in higher income neighborhoods.",
        "9": " . |\n\nA total of , adult DeKalb County residents , representing   census tracts, completed a survey using a combination of snowball and quota sampling. Of these , participants, ,  provided enough information to have their home address geocoded into a census tract via the U.S. Census Bureau online tools. All participants were DeKalb County residents older than\n years of age and only one resident was included from each participating household. All study materials were available in both English and Spanish. DeKalb County is a large , diverse  urban and suburban county with considerable income  and health disparities . For these reasons, DeKalb County served as an excellent site for this line of research.\n\nRespondents' demographics resembled those found in DeKalb County as a whole with the exception of an oversampling of females , those with a college education  and the under-sampling of Latinos . The majority of the sample identified as Black or African American  and the sample was well distributed across age groups, - , - , - , and - . Each census tract within DeKalb County had an average of . responses per tract $.",
        "10": " . |  \n\nThe sampling of residents living in DeKalb County was conducted via online surveys, distributed through neighborhood listservs and local government websites, and paper surveys at community events. These  of data collection were chosen over phone surveys because of evidence demonstrating a dramatic decline in the use of landline telephones , difficulty in reaching residents that work offhours and the benefit of presenting the survey in either English or Spanish. Postal mail surveys were not used because of high cost and low-response rates .\n\nInitial sampling of residents was conducted by using a network of neighborhood e-mail lists that originated from the county's Neighborhood Empowerment Initiative, which organizes a network of over  neighborhood leaders and organizations. Over a -month period, four electronic notices to a network of community leaders asking them to complete and forward an online survey to members of their neighborhood community, who, in turn, were encouraged to pass along information about the survey to other DeKalb County residents . Many leaders then placed advertisements in their neighborhood newsletters, initiated automated calling, and/or placed links to the survey on their websites. Additionally, in coordination with the DeKalb County Board of Health, an advertisement and link to the survey was placed on both the DeKalb County Library and the DeKalb County Government homepages. Last, the researcher and assistants from the DeKalb County Board of Health directly contacted local spiritual groups, community coalitions, and other regional groups and encouraged them to complete the online survey and post notices in newsletters, on websites, and through email listservs.\n\nThe online sampling of residents was also paired with paper-based sampling that focused on targeting groups that had been underrepresented using electronic  . This method has previously been found to be an effective means of improving overall response rates . This was done by setting up tables at numerous community events and meeting with members of senior centers, and residents of low-income neighborhoods to administer paper versions of the survey. For the final sample,   were obtained through paper surveys and   were obtained through online .",
        "11": " . | \n\nThe survey included measures of the neighborhood walking environment , safety , violence , social cohesion , and informal social control . These measures have been previously found to have strong psychometric and ecometric properties . Because of high collinearity between measures at the neighborhood level, the measures of safety and violence  were combined to form a composite neighborhood safety from crime measure , and following previous literature , the measures of informal social control and social cohesion \nwere combined to form a nine-item measure of collective efficacy . Conceptually, the walking environment measure represents individuals' perception of the built environment and collective efficacy and safety from crime represent perceptions of the social environment.\n\nWe included four health care access items from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System  in the questionnaire. Two additional items-\"How long do you have to travel to get to your health care provider?\" and \"If I need to see a specialist, it is easy for me to find one near my home\"were included at the individual level to assess other domains of individual differences in residents' access to health care.\n\nThe dependent variables were overall perceived physical and mental health, measured by the nine-item CDC Health-Related Quality of Life measure , and perceived stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale- . The CDC-HRQOL measure is an empirically validated scale  that comprises a four-item physical health scale and a four-item mental health scale. Consistent with findings from Horner-Johnson et al. , one physical health item-\"Would you say that in general your health is...\"-was omitted in the current study because of a low factor loading. The Perceived Stress Scale was found to have acceptable internal consistency in the current investigation .\n\nAt the individual level, highest obtained education was coded into four groups: those receiving less than a high school diploma, those with a high school diploma or GED , those with an undergraduate degree, and those with a graduate degree. At the neighborhood level, education was coded as a percentage of the number of college graduates within each census tract that responded to the survey. Participant income was an ordinal variable that ranged from -. An increase in one integer corresponded with a  , \\%\\ or more, which is very similar to a census determined county-wide estimate of . Ethnicity/race was measured using a series of dummy variables, with White, non-Hispanic serving as the referent group. Individuals identifying as Hispanic or Latino/a were coded as such, regardless of their identified race. Other dummy coded predictors included whether participants were born in the United States or not  and gender .",
        "12": " . | \n\nAnalyses included individual- and neighborhood-level  covariates and predictors. All participant responses regarding their neighborhood environment  were modeled at both the individual and neighborhood  levels, grand mean centered. We derived the neighborhood-level predictors of walking environment, collective efficacy, and safety from crime by creating a latent aggregate of the individual residents' responses by census tract. The latent covariate approach to creating higher-level predictors has been found to be a more accurate, less biased method than simple mean aggregation of reflective individual-level responses, particularly when ICCs and sampling ratios are small . Simple mean aggregations of individual-level responses to income and age were computed and modeled on the neighborhood level. Individual-level resident income was group mean centered to allow for unbiased cross-level interactions between the individual characteristics and age was grand mean centered to allow for the estimation of contextual effects . The six access to health care items were group mean centered to appropriately assess only individual-level variation and exclude neighborhood level variance.\n\nPrior to hypothesis testing, factor scores were estimated for two of the three dependent variables, physical health, and mental health. This was necessary to account for the count distribution of the factor indicators. The physical health factor was comprised three items and the mental health factor comprised four items, all of which required a response from participants indicating how many days in the last month they had experienced negative physical or mental health symptoms . Consistent with previous research using these measures, all factor indicators were estimated using negative binomial regression to appropriately model the unique distribution of count indicators and account for the presence of overdispersion in each of the indicators .\n\n\nNote. The DeKalb County estimates are based  from U.S.  Census and the -year American Community Survey averages from  to , found at https://factfinder.census.gov/. Cells with a dash mark could not be directly compared because of the differences in the boundaries of the variable.\n\nData were screened to ensure that no recipient completed the survey more than once, and for multiple respondents within households, by including only the first response per home address . A demographic breakdown of this sample appears in Table . Missing data on all endogenous variables was addressed using full-information maximum likelihood under the assumption that missingness is at random conditional on the covariates, leaving a final sample size of , participants. The reduction in sample size was largely due to missing data on income , race/ethnicity , and whether a participant was born in the United States . Despite the reduction in sample size, the final sample size closely coincided with suggested guidelines for investigating multilevel models with random components, which recommends  clusters with  participants per cluster to achieve adequate power . A demographic breakdown of this sample appears in Table .\nAll analyses were conducted using the maximum likelihood estimator with robust standard errors to account for non-normality of the measures. Multilevel structural equation modeling, using Mplus . software , was then employed to test all research questions. The source of measurement  was not predictive of individuals' stress  or physical health,  but did predict respondents' mental health . Although, when the source of measurement  was included in the model, the significance of all other coefficients was identical with or without its inclusion.",
        "13": "  |  \n\nH investigated whether residents perceptions of their neighborhood were associated with differences in individual health outcomes, after controlling for other individual-level variables. Covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, income, education, country of birth, and access to health care. The findings suggest that positive perceptions of residents regarding the walking environment of their neighborhood were associated with better mental health and lower stress . The  also suggest that perceptions of neighborhood safety were associated with physical and mental health. Unexpectedly, positive impressions of one's neighborhood collective efficacy were associated with poorer physical health.\n\nH investigated whether neighborhood-level conditions were associated with individual health outcomes after adjusting for the variance associated with differences in neighborhood perceptions at the individual level. After adjusting for differences associated with individual perceptions of their neighborhood, mean neighborhood income, the average age of neighborhood residents, and the proportion of residents with a college degree, the neighborhood walking environment, collective efficacy, and safety from crime were not associated with an individual's self-reported physical health, mental health, or stress . Mean neighborhood income was statistically significantly associated with better physical health and less perceived stress, and the percentage of college graduates was statistically significantly associated with better physical health.\n\nTo verify that the neighborhood-level null finding was not the result of collinearity between the three neighborhood condition variables, the model was also estimated by assessing each of the three neighborhood condition variables separately. Despite moderate bivariate correlations between the neighborhood-level conditions variables and the dependent variables , none of the neighborhood condition variables were significantly related to health after controlling for neighborhood-level income and education. The neighborhood condition variables were found to be significantly associated with the dependent variables only after removing both neighborhood income and education from the model. This resulted in neighborhood condition variables being significantly associated with the outcomes of interest: greater collective efficacy was associated with lower stress  and better physical health , and better walking environment was associated with lower stress .\n\nH investigated whether the association between individual income and individual health outcomes were dependent upon neighborhood-level income and whether the association between identifying as an African American/Black and individual health status was dependent upon neighborhood-level income. Specifically, we were interested in determining if low-income individuals reported better health when living in a high-income neighborhood  and if Black residents would report better health when living in a high-income neighborhood . This was done by examining the estimated paths from the neighborhood-level variables to the within-level slopes for each of the three dependent variables, all included in a single model .  from the multilevel model found the following:  the association between individual income and physical health was moderated by mean neighborhood income,  );  the association between identifying as Black, compared to White, and mental health was moderated by neighborhood income,  ); and  the association between identifying as Black, compared to White, and perceived stress was moderated by mean neighborhood income, .

        "14": "  | \n\nThis study investigated individual and neighborhood-level predictors of perceived stress, mental health, and physical health. Findings are consistent with the overall premise of the study, that neighborhood characteristics play a role in health, over and above the role of individual characteristics. Because members of ethnic minority groups and people in lower socioeconomic strata typically live in lower quality neighborhoods  and experience poorer health, the study highlights the importance of neighborhood environments in furthering understanding of health disparities.\n\nAfter controlling for neighborhood and individual-level confounds, there were no significant main effects of neighborhood-level safety from crime, collective efficacy, or the walking environment. However, differences in residents' perception of their neighborhood were significantly associated with mental health, physical health, and stress. Specifically, the more positively residents perceived their neighborhoods' walking environment, the better their mental health and the lower their stress, and the more residents felt safe from crime, the better they reported their physical and mental health. These findings confirm previous research that suggests individuals' perceptions of their environment are associated with health outcomes above and beyond neighborhood-level factors .\n\nUnlike some previous research, our study did not find associations between neighborhood-level conditions  and health outcomes. Previous research investigating the neighborhood environment has often neglected to control for neighborhood-level SES factors, such as income and education . Chaix, Leal, and Evans  argue that controlling for neighborhood-level income when investigating neighborhood conditions is as necessary as controlling for individual-level income when investigating individual-level perceptions.\n\nMoreover, Chaix and colleagues  recommend that researchers include measures of neighborhood-level socioeconomic position when assessing neighborhood environments unless the researcher has a clearly articulated argument of why it may not be appropriate . In the current study, safety from\ncrime, collective efficacy, or the walking environment did not have significant associations with health outcomes when neighborhood income and education were included in the model, suggesting a tendency for affluent and well-educated families to choose to live in neighborhoods with desirable characteristics, or that such communities are better able to achieve desirable characteristics. Either way, it appears that neighborhood affluence and education are more central predictors of health outcomes than characteristics of the social and built environment.\n\nIt is possible that the associations between neighborhood perceptions and health are largely an individual-level phenomenon, despite  of the neighborhood perception variance being found at the neighborhood level. Previous research has found that negative perceptions of the neighborhood environment are associated with worse physical health, worse mental health, and higher stress . This suggests that individuals' unique perception of their environment explains a significant amount of variance even after accounting for neighborhood-level SES and neighborhood-level perceptions. It is likely that individuals differ in their experiences and interpretation of events and conditions in their neighborhood, differences that could be because of dispositional characteristics of individuals such as unique personality traits, or systematic differences in their exposure to discrimination or another unmeasured phenomenon. Moreover, because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, it is possible those individuals in poor health simply perceived their neighborhood differently than individuals in good health.\n\nThe hypothesized associations between collective efficacy and health were not supported. Instead, participants reporting higher levels of neighborhood collective efficacy tended to report poorer physical health . Because of the cross-sectional nature of this study, it is impossible to determine the direction of causation implied by this association. It may be that individuals who are in poor physical health rely more on their neighbors for assistance. Because of this, they may perceive greater levels of collective efficacy than individuals who have less need to rely on neighbors.\n\nPrior research investigating interactions between individual and neighborhood income has been limited and has often produced contradictory  . For example, studies with U.S. samples, conducted by Winkleby et al. , found that low-income residents living in higher SES neighborhoods had higher mortality rates than low-income residents who lived in low SES neighborhoods. However, Boylan and Robert  found that for low-income residents, living in a higher SES neighborhood  does result in improved health. Our findings are consistent with Boylan and Robert's study, experimental studies on neighborhood effects , studies that have included racially diverse samples , and those using the same outcome measures . In accord with the current study, it is possible that individuals of low personal income who lived in higher-income neighborhoods reported better physical health because they had better access to neighborhood resources, healthier social norms, and higher selfefficacy .\n\nConsistent with studies by Subramanian et al.  and Jones et al. , this study found that Black participants who lived in high-income neighborhoods reported better mental health than Black participants who lived in low-income neighborhoods. Additionally, Black participants who lived in low-income neighborhoods reported significantly more stress than Black participants who lived in high-income neighborhoods. Their study found that Black residents who lived in a low-income neighborhood were at a higher risk for mortality than White residents who lived in a low-income neighborhood. These findings suggest that after controlling for individual income and other social factors, neighborhood-level income potentially amplifies disparities between White and Black residents living in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the associations between individual income and neighborhood-level income, and the individual race and neighborhood income are not associated with residents' health equally. It is possible that low-income residents and Black residents that live in low-income neighborhoods are particularly vulnerable to experiencing low self-efficacy due to their greater exposure to more similar peers. For example, individuals of higher personal income or nonminority status are more likely to have more interactions with family and friends of higher social status who live outside their neighborhood simply by the stratification of low-income neighborhoods.\nAdditionally, it is also possible that individuals of low personal income and minorities that live in low-income neighborhoods suffer from a greater accumulation of stressors, such as racism, discrimination, or other detrimental influences such as environmentally degraded environments. Subsequently, the greater accumulation of stressors may outweigh the potential positives that residents may gain by living with more similar peers such as stronger ties with neighbors, the availability of culturally relevant spiritual centers, or resources for low-income residents.",
        "15": " . |  \n\nThis study used a large diverse sample to investigate the potential for individual and neighborhood determinants of health using advanced statistical techniques that controlled for numerous confounds at both the individual and neighborhood levels. Unlike many previous studies, this study also included a diverse sample of residents who lived in a wide range of neighborhoods. This enabled us to examine the influence of neighborhood environments when investigating neighborhoods with Black representation in low- and high-income environments.\n\nAn important limitation of the current investigation is that participants were not randomly selected. Instead, a convenience sample of residents was obtained through notifications about the study sent to county e-mail lists, placed on public websites, and in-person recruitment at community events. This method may have led to a lack of participation by individuals with the lowest income and education, and only limited representation by individuals within each neighborhood. Nevertheless, the final study sample included a diverse sample that generally reflected the demographic diversity of the county as a whole, albeit with an undersampling of Latinos and oversampling of females and those with higher education. Additionally, neighborhood level variables were derived from individual-level responses. While not ideal, research has suggested that it may not introduce biases not found using alternative  \n\nThe cross-sectional and observational nature of this study limited causal inferences that can be made. It is possible that associations between individual characteristics such as income or education are actually caused by health . For example, individuals with poor health may be less able to obtain education or earnings; however, this causal dilemma cannot be solved simply by conducting longitudinal analyses because the associations among health and socioeconomic variables are likely reciprocally related throughout one's life. For instance, Kawachi and colleagues  produce several scenarios in which poor health may cause or be associated with poorer health, beyond limitations in productivity, including the lower probability for children with early chronic health conditions to graduate from college  and overweight women's lower likelihood of marrying a spouse of high social status .",
        "16": " . |\n\nThe current study finds that the average income of residents within neighborhoods interacts with individual income, in the case of physical health, and interacts with race, in the case of mental health and stress. The potential benefits offered to low-income residents living in higher income neighborhoods are likely to include healthier social norms, higher self-efficacy, and less toxic environments.\n\nThis study also found that Black residents, compared to White residents, may be more vulnerable to hazards associated with living in a low-income neighborhood. It is possible that Black residents report greater stress than White residents when living in low-income neighborhoods because of the greater accumulation of life stressors such as discrimination and racism . Williams  suggests that Black residents endure the added burden of racism compared to White residents of the same socioeconomic status and that individual and institutional discrimination along with other stigmas of inferiority adversely affects health both directly and indirectly. Consequently, Black residents living in low-income neighborhoods may face a form of double jeopardy not faced by White residents in any neighborhood.\n\nImplications for researchers, interventionists, and policymakers include the need for researchers to include measures of neighborhood level income as a predictor of health outcomes when other measures of neighborhood char-\nacteristics such as the social and built environment are of interest. Additionally, even when the primary focus of the research is on effects of social and built environment, it is important that researchers consider how residents' experience and interpret the same neighborhood differently; such individual differences in perception may be important predictors of health. This study also supports the need for researchers to consider a wide range of potential determinants of health not often found in neighborhood health research such as measures of access to health care. In particular, this study found that residents who did not receive health care treatment because the costs were too high reported worse health and more stress. More research is needed to understand how the high cost of health care in the United States adversely affects one's health above and beyond the possession of health insurance and personal wealth.\n\nInterventionists and policymakers should consider the potential for health benefits associated with enabling low-income residents to live in higher income neighborhoods through voucher programs or the creation of more low-income housing options in higher income neighborhoods. This study found that low-income residents and Black residents reported better health when they lived in higher income neighborhoods, while the mean income of the neighborhood made no significant difference for high-income and White residents. It should also be noted that the low-income residents that lived in higher income neighborhoods in this study lived there presumably by choice and not necessarily because of the closing of public housing communities or other low-income housing. A significant amount of debate has surrounded the closing and subsequently required moving of all residents out of public housing communities . These types of forced moves potentially disrupt residents' social network and the availability of established resources. The outcomes associated with these types of interventions are likely quite different from the optional moves made available through the Moving to Opportunities programs  and the findings of this study.",
        "17": " . |  \n\nThis study finds that racial disparities in health may be due in part to interactions between individual and neighborhood income, access to health care, and differences in residents' perceptions of their neighborhood. While this investigation did not incorporate all likely predictors of health, it did include a wide spectrum of potential determinants rarely found in a single study. Future extensions of this research would benefit from a longitudinal design and greater representation of Latino and Asian residents because it is quite possible that these findings do not generalize outside the largely Black-White dichotomy found in this study."
