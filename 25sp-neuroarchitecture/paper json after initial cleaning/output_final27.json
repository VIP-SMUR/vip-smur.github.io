        "6": " \n\nPhysiological stress can be examined via the measurement of cortisol. During stress, two of the body's main physiological stress response systems, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis and autonomic nervous system , are activated resulting in cortisol secretion . Short-term activation of both the HPA axis and ANS due to stress is adaptive and essential for normal functioning; however, repeated activation can lead to cortisol dysregulation and poor stress recovery, both of which are related to physical and psychological ill health .\n\nExposure to nature has been demonstrated to provide positive health outcomes. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that direct contact with natural places  improves self-esteem and mood, fosters mental wellbeing and encourages physical activity ; all of which can reduce stress . Research suggests that simply viewing a natural environment  in reductions in salivary cortisol, whilst people living in neighborhoods with more greenspace have healthier cortisol profiles than those living in neighborhoods\nwith little greenspace . Furthermore, recent research by Hunter et al.  demonstrated that a nature experience resulted in a  hour drop in cortisol beyond the diurnal drop of  hour; with the greatest benefits occurring for experiences lasting between  and  minutes.\n\nPA is also a remedy for many stress-related illnesses . Research has identified that individuals who are more physically active have improved cortisol profiles and reduced physiological responses to stressors . The cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis suggests that these improved stress responses occur due to biological adaptations which result from regular PA .\n\nBeing physically active whilst exposed to natural environments  provides additive benefits for wellbeing above PA or nature contact alone . These benefits are derived from all types of natural spaces, exercise intensities and as little as five minutes of engagement . However, despite the growing evidence for the benefits of GE, there is little evidence of its direct impact on stress outcomes. One such study examined the impact of GE on stress recovery and found that engaging in GE following a stressor was more effective at aiding physiological stress recovery than reading indoors . This was supported by Gladwell et al. , who found that a lunch time GE walk resulted in greater heart rate variability during sleep , and therefore recovery, than a walk in a non-natural environment. However, research has not examined the impact of partaking in GE immediately prior to a stressor. Wood et al.  did reveal that a -minute moderate intensity walk resulted in lower salivary cortisol levels following a psychosocial stressor ) compared to individuals who did no PA; but the walk included both natural and non-natural environments and did not isolate the impact of the natural environment. Furthermore, the impact of contrasting exercise environments was not examined, and the intensity of exercise was not specific to the participants' individual fitness levels. Given the negative impact of high stress reactivity on health outcomes , strategies for reducing responses to stress are of importance. The aim of this pilot study was therefore to examine the influence of the visual exercise environment on the response to a psychosocial stressor. It was hypothesized that there would be differences in stress reactivity and recovery, measured via salivary cortisol and self-report measures of stress, between different environmental viewing conditions.",

Participants were recruited through emails to university staff and students, posters placed around the university, social media posts and word of mouth. To take part in the study participants were required to be between the ages of  and  years, moderately physically active, free from physical and mental ill health, and fit to take part in PA. Fitness to take part in PA was determined through the use of the PA readiness questionnaire ; for inclusion in the study participants were required to answer \"no\" to all questions.\n\nParticipant's habitual PA levels were determined via the international PA questionnaire short form, which asks about their vigorous, moderate and walking activities in the last seven days and the time spent in each intensity of PA . Participants were deemed to be moderately active if they engaged in: i. three or more days of vigorous intensity activity of at least  minutes; ii. five or more days of moderate intensity PA and/or walking of at least  minutes; iii. a combination of vigorous, moderate and walking activities achieving a minimum total of at least  Metabolic\nEquivalent of Task  minutes per week. The total MET minutes was determined by the following calculation:\n$.\n\nAll participants provided individual consent to take part in the study, with institutional ethical approval provided by the University of Westminster ethics committee.

On the first visit participants had demographic information collected and had their height and weight assessed for the calculation of body mass index. An online questionnaire was also completed to assess trait health and behavioral outcomes. This included assessment of wellbeing, perceived stress, beliefs about GE and frequency of nature exposure and GE participation. Participants were next fitted with a Polar heart rate monitor  and asked to perform a warm up. The warm up consisted of . min self-selected treadmill walking or jogging, followed by a further . min of self-guided stretching. Following the warm-up participants were asked to take part in a  max test on the treadmill, whereby they were required to run until volitional exhaustion . Throughout the test participants' expired gases were examined using a cortex analyser , along with ratings of perceived exertion  and heart rate. These measures were used to determine the participant's maximum oxygen consumption. Immediately following the  max test participants cooled down on the treadmill for a further . min followed by . min of stretches.\n\nThe second visit to the university took place at least one week after the  max test. Participants were required to exercise on the treadmill for  min at the speed at which they had previously reached  of their  max. During this exercise, participants were randomly allocated to one of three viewing conditions: i. nature video; ii. built environment video and; iii. control. Participants watched their allocated video  for the duration of the exercise and had no engagement with the researchers during this time. Before and after the exercise participants completed the warm up and cool down procedures followed during the  max test session.\n\nFigure . Study timeline.\nImmediately following the exercise, participants took part in the Trier Social Stress Test  . Salivary cortisol samples were collected before the exercise and throughout the stress testing period; whilst the Stress-Arousal Checklist  was completed before the exercise and before and after the stress test. At this time participants were also asked to rate the ease, intrusiveness, enjoyment and comfort of the exercise intervention on a scale from one to seven; with a higher score indicating more enjoyment and comfort and less intrusion and difficulty. A mean score for all four variables was also calculated to provide an overall rating of the intervention, a higher score indicated a better experience.",

Following the warm up, participants were fitted with a face mask , which was attached to their face using a mesh head harness.

The starting speed for the  max test ranged from  to , depending on the participants' prior experience; and increased by  after each minute of the test. On completion of each minute of the test oxygen uptake, rating of perceived exertion  and heart rate were recorded. Participants were verbally encouraged to continue for as long as possible and until they felt they could no longer continue. When the participants could not proceed with the test they were asked to jump to the sides of the treadmill. The participants' maximal oxygen uptake  was calculated by taking the average oxygen uptake from the last  s of the test.",

These numbers corresponded to allocation to either a: i. nature video; ii. built environment video or; iii. control. In the nature condition, the video consisted of scenes extracted from \"Evening Run through Endless Forest;\" whilst in the built condition, the video consisted of scenes extracted from the \"Boston Marathon Route\" . These videos were previously used in the study of Rogerson and Barton . In the control condition participants exercised whilst viewing a blank screen. Immediately prior to the exercise participants also rested for ten minutes, after which the first salivary cortisol sample was collected .",

The TSST comprises uncontrollability and socio-evaluative threat known to reliably activate the HPA axis . The TSST included three main phases:  the preparatory period ;  the stress task period ; and  a resting and debriefing period . During the preparatory period participants were briefed on the stress test procedures and given  -minutes of quiet time to prepare notes for a mock job interview where they were asked to prepare a  -minute speech as if applying for a job in their field and to introduce themselves to the committee. On completion of these preparation tasks participants were asked to provide a second saliva sample .\nDuring the TSST participants were moved into an additional room and were instructed to stand in front of a seated committee consisting of one man and one woman. The committee were wearing white laboratory coats. There were also two video cameras pointing at the participants. A committee member asked each participant to make their five-minute speech. Standard responses were given by the committee when participants ended their speech early . On completion of the speech  the third saliva sample  was collected.\n\nThe committee then asked the participants to serially subtract  from a given number as fast and accurately as possible for  min . If participants failed in the subtraction task, standard responses were employed . Following the arithmetic task saliva sample four was collected. Immediately after completion of the TSST participants returned to the preparation room. Participants provided saliva samples every  min up to  min . During this time, they were also debriefed on the study.",

As is common, cortisol values were moderately skewed. To normalize data a square root transformation was performed  prior to statistical analyses. However, for illustration purposes untransformed values are presented in the tables and figures. A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to examine differences in cortisol over time. Within-subjects contrasts were used to assess the pattern of cortisol secretion. Cortisol stress reactivity was calculated as the increase from the baseline sample, measured immediately prior to the TSST ,\nand the participant's individual peak sample . Cortisol recovery was calculated as the participant's individual peak sample minus the final sample . In line with the recommendations of Miller et al.  non-responders were identified as participants that did not exhibit an increase of cortisol . We, therefore, excluded four participants  who were classified as non-responders.

To date, there are no known studies examining the influence of different exercise environments immediately prior to a stressor on stress reactivity. The authors of the current study did previously identify that a -minute moderate intensity walk in a green area via an urban area immediately prior to the TSST resulted in significantly reduced overall cortisol levels when compared to no physical activity ; however, the possible effect of the exercise environment was not examined.\n\nAlthough higher cortisol stress reactivity has been associated with poorer health outcomes; recent studies have also demonstrated that lower  cortisol responding, represented by a smaller increase in cortisol from baseline to peak, is just as indicative of poor health . In fact, larger cortisol reactivity might be protective against stress-related depression, with evidence suggesting that individuals suffering from clinical depression might have blunted cortisol stress reactivity and impaired recovery . Blunted responding to a psychosocial stressor is predictive of poorer physical and mental health later on in life, as shown by prospective studies . The lower cortisol reactivity in the built group, when compared to both the nature and control condition , might, therefore, be indicative of a negative impact of the built exercise environment on stress reactivity. Previous GE research by Pretty et al.  revealed that exercise whilst viewing a built environment reduced the positive effects of exercise on self-esteem when compared to exercise when viewing natural environments or exercise alone. If we consider the findings of this research in the context of lower  cortisol responding, a similar effect is identified; whereby exercising in built environments has adverse effects on cortisol reactivity. The exact mechanisms for this potential effect are unclear, but one possible explanation is focused on the effect of different environments on mental fatigue and attention. According to the attention restoration theory ; natural environments are restorative and can, therefore, reduce mental fatigue and improve attention. By contrast, built environments can contribute to mental fatigue and result in reduced attentional capacity . Given that the TSST requires focused attention and that mental fatigue can impair emotional regulation ; it is possible that the blunted cortisol reactivity in the built environment group resulted from a reduced capacity to regulate emotions. However, this idea is speculative and further research would be required to assess mental fatigue, emotional regulation and cortisol reactivity following exposure to different environments.\n\nIn addition to the reduced cortisol reactivity, participants in the built environment condition experienced a significantly greater increase in self-reported state stress from pre-exercise to prestress test compared to the nature viewing condition. This finding is supported by the significant negative relationship between stress reactivity and self-reported stress prior to the TSST; with the most stressed participants  having the least cortisol reactivity. The nature viewing condition resulted in the smallest increases in self-reported state stress; in support of the growing body of evidence suggesting a beneficial impact of GE on self-reported health outcomes .\n\nParticipants in the nature viewing condition also reported that their experience of the exercise was most enjoyable and comfortable and least difficult; with an overall better experience. Although these findings were not significant, they could be indicative of a role of GE in influencing exercise\nadherence. In fact, previous research has demonstrated that participants experience greater enjoyment and intention for future exercise participation when exercising in an outdoor natural environment compared to either an indoor or built environment . Given the low levels of PA in adults ; strategies for increasing participation are essential and these relationships, therefore, warrant further investigation\n\nThe current study was a well-controlled and intensive pilot study that rigorously controlled exercise intensity according to individual fitness levels and included a control group who exercised in front of a blank screen. However, there are some limitations that require consideration. Firstly, due to the intensive nature of this pilot study, there were only a small number of participants in each exercise group. The study therefore needs to be replicated on a larger scale to confirm the same trend of  in a larger population. Furthermore, participants were moderately active and had higher than average fitness. The average  max for males and females was . and  respectively, representing above average fitness in both groups . Given the positive impact of both fitness and habitual PA on stress outcomes ; it is therefore not possible to generalize these  to the wider population and inactive groups. Future research should therefore incorporate participants from a variety of PA and fitness groups to ensure that the findings are applicable to a wider audience.\n\nThe use of \"artificial\" exercise environments is also a key study limitation; as the multi-sensory experience  of exercising in a natural environment was unlikely to have been felt by participants. However, the laboratory environment enables the exercise characteristics to be rigorously controlled, not just in terms of exercise intensity but also factors such as temperature and humidity which could influence exercise outcomes. This approach is therefore essential to demonstrate the principle of the GE effect and has been utilized in other published studies . It should also be noted that there are several groups in society who may be unable to access \"real\" natural environments and for whom artificially stimulated natural environments might be important, for example those who are in highly urbanized areas with no nature access or confined to indoor settings. Further consideration of how the full sensory experience of nature can be created indoors, for example through the use of virtual reality software, is therefore essential to furthering research in this field and exploring the findings of this research more widely.\n\nOverall the findings of this well-controlled and intensive pilot study where participants exercise was matched to their fitness level, revealed differences in cortisol reactivity to a psychosocial stressor between those viewing natural and built environments. Participants in the built condition had significantly reduced cortisol stress reactivity and greater increases in self-reported stress than participants who took part in a natural environment viewing condition. There were also significant negative relationships between cortisol reactivity and self-reported stress. In the context of the negative health impact of blunted cortisol responding, these findings could indicate a negative impact of the built exercise environment on stress responses and an undoing of the positive effects of exercise. Additional and larger scale studies are required to explore and confirm these concepts further."
