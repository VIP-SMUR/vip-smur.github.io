        "3": " \n\nThe issue of ensuring the well-being of residents is central to systems of municipal governance. The purpose of our study is to measure the well-being of residents in an urban environment and, based on the obtained , to identify problem areas that impede the achievement of strategic development goals in the megapolis. We conducted a representative survey of residents in one of the largest industrialized Russian megacities, Ekaterinburg. Based on the survey data, an index of subjective well-being in the urban environment was obtained, which included  blocks of assessment indicators: ) assessment of the current state of the urban environment; ) assessment of the changes in the urban environment; ) assessment of personal well-being; and ) assessment of intentions to live in the city. The study revealed that the most prosperous citizens in the urban environment are: - years old; married; employed. The problems of low well-being and the absence of youth intent to connect their futures with the city are identified as the main threats to the megapolis' development. The  of our study are of practical importance for making informed management decisions in urban restructuring planning, urban infrastructure upgrades, and the development of social policy measures aimed at improving the quality of life and well-being of citizens.\n\n\n Well-being, megapolis, urban environment, residents, survey",
        "4": " \n\nRecent rapid urbanization and its associated negative effects have made the creation of a high-quality and comfortable living environment for urban residents highly relevant. Comfortable, convenient, open, and safe cities are an integral part of the new sustainable development agenda . Overloaded infrastructure and support systems, along with the environmental and social problems of large cities, have stimulated the emergence of various programs and projects aimed at improving the urban environment.\n\nOfficial reports from municipal authorities often present cities as \"statistical reports\", where they are characterised in terms of indicators showing life expectancy, birth rates, GDP, the construction of housing, highways, roads, and social welfare facilities, and the  of digital technologies and electronic services. While recognizing the extreme importance of the conceptualisation of a city as a mosaic of objective statistical data, we would also note that it is important not to \"lose\" people in the pursuit of formal indicators. A city is for people. Human assessments of the urban environment and the study of resident well-being are essential for implementing sustainable development strategies and assessing a city's real, concrete existence. This approach makes it necessary to learn how residents assess their wellbeing, the parameters of the urban environment, and the \"efforts\" of the authorities, as well as how comfortable they feel in their city and whether they want to connect their futures with it. The value of subjective indicators lies in the analysis of sociodemographic subgroups and the establishment of determinants of high / low life satisfaction as an information resource for the development of measures aimed at improving the well-being of the population and its individual groups .\n\nThe well-being of the population is a pressing issue for Russian socioeconomic policy in its regions and cities. Negative shifts in Russian quality of life caused by the economic crisis and deepening social inequality  require social policy measures aimed at achieving a balance between the economic and social components of sustainable development. Since people are the main capital of a territory, considering their subjective opinions is a necessary element in assessing the position of specific cities on the \"quality of life\" scale, as well as developing priority directions for improving certain areas of the urban environment.\n\nThe purpose of our study is to measure the well-being of residents in an urban environment and, based on the obtained , to identify problem areas that impede the achievement of strategic development goals in the megapolis. We conducted a representative survey of residents in one of the largest industrialized Russian megacities, Ekaterinburg . Based on the survey data, an index of subjective well-being in the urban environment was obtained, which included  blocks of assessment indicators: ) assessment of the current state of the urban environment; ) assessment of the changes in the urban environment; ) assessment of personal well-being; and ) assessment of intentions to live in the city.",
        "5": " . Literature review \n\nThe topic of the population well-being is not new in academics. Extensive experience in studying this area has been accumulated in international practice . Many international and national research organizations have developed well-being measurement  and conduct research on a regular basis. At present, the interest in this topic is\nincreasing because of the consequences of the global financial crisis and the need for national governments and city administrations to take adequate measures to maintain/improve current living standards .\nD. Smith's work was one of the first fundamental studies on measuring urban and regional well-being. He explored the geography of social well-being in the United States via statistical data . Since then, the number of studies and measurement techniques for developing well-being has steadily increased. Researchers are not unanimous in defining the concept of well-being, which reflects its multidimensional nature  and, accordingly, a variety of indicators measuring it. Long-term research practice has allowed researchers to develop a general construct where well-being is empirically operationalized as a very broad concept through which one analyzes how well people live. This construct consists of  broad areas that define vectors for measuring well-being: society, economy, environment, management, and personal resources .\n\nFor example, OECD identifies  key areas for measuring well-being: material conditions and quality of life. Material conditions cover aspects such as income and wealth, jobs and earnings, and housing. Quality of life is defined here as a combination of non-monetary attributes that form people's opportunities and prospects and have lasting value across various cultures and contexts. Quality of life covers aspects such as work-life balance, health status, education and skills, social connections, civic engagement and governance, environmental quality, personal security, and subjective well-being. The New Economics Foundation measures well-being based on a different structure of indicators: personal and social well-being. Personal well-being includes the measurement of the following subcomponents: emotional well-being, life satisfaction, vitality, resilience and selfesteem, and positive functioning. Social well-being includes supportive relationships, trust, and belonging. The Gallup company, together with Healthways, measures well-being with  elements, based on global survey data: ) Purpose ; ) Social ; ) Financial ; ) Community ; and ) Physical  .\n\nThe academic literature and research group reports use the terms \"quality of life\" and \"happiness\" along with the term \"well-being\", often as interchangeable categories of analysis . In our opinion, there are some nuances between them. \"Happiness\" is, to a greater extent, a psychological category associated with positive feelings, emotions, and moods . The term \"quality of life\" is more appropriate to use in relation to objective living conditions, whereas well-being is\nused in relation to the subjective assessment of these conditions . Subjective assessments of quality of life reflect objective circumstances and people's reactions to these circumstances . A wide range of life conditions and circumstances, in turn, determines the different types of measurable well-being, including well-being in an urban environment.\n\nBallas notes that most urban research was based on an objective approach until recently . This makes it relatively easy to measure the factors of the social and physical environment of a city, which determine the wellbeing of a person living in it . These factors are: income, housing, consumption, urban amenities, environmental pollution, etc. However, the last decade saw increased interest in the subjective indicators of the quality of urban life and the well-being of citizens. These indicators can be obtained from population surveys, in which people evaluate their perception of urban life and satisfaction with its various aspects. Currently, the importance of the subjective component in studies of urban well-being is increasing. This stems from the application of pluralistic approaches to urban development management . The importance of considering the needs and opinions of residents is becoming increasingly apparent in light of the widely discussed involvement of urban residents in the city governance . Today, most urbanists agree that the assessments and opinions of citizens should be considered by the municipal authorities as a necessary information basis for improving urban infrastructure, urban design, and reconstruction.",
        "7": " . Case Description\n\nEkaterinburg ranks fourth among  Russian cities with a population of over one million people. According to municipal statistical data,  people live there. Historically, Ekaterinburg had the status of Russia's \"industrial capital\". Metallurgical and engineering industries were the basis of its economy. Over the past  years, qualitative changes have occurred in Ekaterinburg - namely, the transition from the \"old industrial\" regional megapolis to a city which is modern, innovative, high-tech, investment-attractive, and open to international contacts. The city's geographical position on the border of Europe and Asia determines its status as a transit center and the country's third largest transport hub. Ekaterinburg has hosted the summits of SCO and BRICS, FIFA World Cup matches.\n\nEkaterinburg is a megapolis with a large resource pool of political and civil activity. Citizens' initiatives to uphold their \"rights to the city\" is typical in Ekaterinburg. For example, civil actions aimed at protecting public spaces from \"undesirable\" construction projects that violate the unique atmosphere of established pastime practices receive powerful public and media resonance at the federal level. They also show other cities the possibilities for residents to influence the decision-making of city authorities.",
        "8": " . Data and  \n\nOur study was carried out using a subjective approach that involves measuring well-being based on a survey of residents. In total, we surveyed , Ekaterinburg residents. For the survey, we used a two-stage sample stratified by the city's microdistricts, with proportional distribution of units within each stratum. Age and gender quotas were monitored within the groups of respondents by their microdistricts. The sample reflects the structure of the Ekaterinburg population by gender, age, and micro-territory. We examined the well-being of residents in an urban living environment in close relation with a complex of elements of urban infrastructure and facilities. We did not study emotional assessments or affective reactions. We focused solely on measuring rational cognitive assessments.\n\nWe used four groups of indicators to measure resident assessments: ) Assessment of the current state of the urban environment, was based on  indicators measuring satisfaction with various spheres of urban life; ) Assessment of the dynamics of the urban environment - an assessment of the changes in urban infrastructure over the past  years; ) Assessment of personal well-being - a combination of two indicators - self-assessment of the material situation and the housing conditions of the respondents; ) The connection of personal and family future with the city . In total,  indicators were included in the four groups. We standardized their values , then calculated the group indicators . Next, we assigned the same weight to all subindexes and calculated the integral index of urban resident wellbeing. We described the values of the variables using descriptive statistics. Since the mean was unreliable in some cases, we focused on the median values. We used nonparametric statistics  to assess differences in the index values in groups of respondents, since the distribution of the variables' values was not normal.",
        "9": " . \n\n) The residents of Ekaterinburg assess the current state of the urban environment as \"slightly above average\". The residents most often assign the highest assessments to certain areas in the urban environment . The respondents express the greatest dissatisfaction when assessing the improvement of the city and its appearance, as well as healthcare, entertainment, the environmental situation, and car parking .\n) Assessments of the dynamics of the urban environment over the past five years are quite different. The share of citizens who notice positive changes is almost three times greater than the share of those who see changes in different directions or do not notice any changes in the city at all is extremely large - almost three quarters of all respondents .\n) The assessment of personal well-being, which we measured through a self-assessment of material well-being and housing conditions, gave the following  . It should be noted that the residents evaluated the living conditions higher than the material ones. For example, only  of respondents rated their material well-being as high, while  of respondents estimated their housing conditions as such.\n) The intentions of respondents regarding Ekaterinburg  are presented in Table . The desire to connect one's fate with the city decreases as the planning horizon expands and concerns future generations of the family. Less than half of the residents chose Ekaterinburg as the place of residence of their future grandchildren.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n) The integral index of city resident well-being has the following characteristics . The values of the integral index of city resident wellbeing are associated with several objective socio-demographic variables: occupation, age and marital status . The  show that the highest values of the well-being index are observed in the residents who: are employed; are aged -; and are married. We recorded the lowest well-being index in the following population groups: high-school students; people under ; widowed and single people.\n) We identified the strongest relationship of individual group variables that form the integral well-being index of a city resident with objective sociodemographic indicators that demonstrated a relationship with the integral index. The strongest relationships are as follows:\n\n- Assessment of personal well-being and the age of respondents . We recorded a downward trend in this assessment as resident age increases.\n- The connection of personal and family future with the city and respondent occupation. It should be noted that the strength of this relationship is somewhat reduced when the issue of intergenerational habitation in the city is considered . Table  shows that retirees are most keen on connecting\ntheir own future, as well as the futures of their children and grandchildren, with Ekaterinburg. Employed people are less certain about this. The vast majority of university students and  high-school students do not connect the future of their families with Ekaterinburg: less than a third of university students and just over a sixth of high-school students would like their grandchildren to live in this city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe well-being of residents in an urban environment: the case of a Russian megapolis\nFigure . Personal well-being assessment by respondent age groups",
        "10": " . \n\nOur study showed that the well-being of megapolis residents can be examined not only through indicators of personal well-being, but also through indicators \"tied\" to the specifics of the urban environment. The urban environment is an integral component of assessing the well-being of city residents as it provides opportunities to realize their diverse needs and practices  . The methodology for studying resident well-being in the urban\nenvironment, which was developed and tested during the study, is open for and adjustments. The set of indicators is not exhaustive, and it largely reflects the current development tasks of a particular megapolis, which were identified during experts with representatives of the city authorities.\n\nOn the one hand, the  of the study identified the positive trends in the movement towards development in the city. On the other, the  revealed problems in urban development that require close attention from the authorities. The positive trends are evidenced by a significant share of citizens  with index values above the average. The negative facts of urban development are evidenced by a low assessment of individual elements of urban infrastructure. The lower well-being of youth, compared to other population groups, is an alarming symptom for the prospects of urban development. For example, high-school students have the lowest well-being index. University students are in rd place on the well-being scale, after employed residents and retirees. In addition, high-school and university students are less likely to connect their personal future  with the city than other population groups. Of course, it is necessary to consider the socio-psychological characteristics of youth  and the remoteness of future situations  when interpreting these negative intentions. However, we revealed a similar situation in the other population groups: most of the city's residents connect only their own futures with Ekaterinburg; predictions of the futures of their children and grandchildren reduce the number of positive responses. Preventive social policy to retain youth and to form \"attachment\" and a sense of belonging to the city should be aimed at increasing urban attractiveness and informing young people about the opportunities for self-realization and professional and creative achievements in the urban space.\n\nOther studies confirm a number of social and economic determinants of well-being which were identified in our study. This indicates the existence of certain general patterns in people's satisfaction with their lives. For example, it was proved that marital status influences the subjective feeling of well-being and happiness: single people are less happy and less satisfied with their lives . The  of our study clearly demonstrate this relationship: the highest well-being index is observed in married people, followed by divorced, never married, and widowed. We also found that the well-being index for unemployed citizens is much lower than for the employed ones. Many researchers who have studied the effects of unemployment on well-being have noted a strong negative correlation between these two variables. Being unemployed negatively affects the subjective feeling of well-being and satisfaction with life, and this effect cannot be explained only in terms of loss of income: significant non-material effects are suggested . The extremely negative effect of unemployment on life satisfaction is manifested in its long-term consequences: even when people start working again, their satisfaction with life often does not return to its previous level . In addition, there is evidence that\nincome loss affects well-being significantly more than income growth . In this context, our findings are consistent with studies that discuss the influence of income and wealth on subjective well-being. The fact that financial security contributes to higher subjective well-being  is obvious and understandable. Material well-being allows people to improve their quality of life by acquiring the best medical care, education, recreation, and other life benefits. Although, in fairness, it is worth noting that there are several studies that dispute the direct positive effect of income and wealth on subjective wellbeing.s about the Easterlin Paradox  have led to a search for the indirect explanatory factors of this situation. For example, S. Oishi and S. Kesebir, who compared different countries, found that an increase in GDP per capita leads to an increase in happiness only if it is not accompanied by an increase in income inequality . Moreover, there is a significant influence of hedonistic adaptation to better living standards, as well as the effect of social comparison, i.e. the comparison of one's own income with the incomes of reference groups .\n\nThe influence of demographic variables such as age and gender has received considerable attention ins about the well-being determinants. In both early and later studies, it is often argued that age and well-being/happiness are -shaped dependent - that is, people feel happier and more prosperous when they are younger and when they are older . However, our study does not confirm a -shaped dependency. The highest wellbeing index is observed among residents aged -. This is the age of the highest professional and social activity, career achievements, and earnings growth. These groups of people are active users of all facilities and services of the urban space, including those which must be paid for. In our opinion, the active use of the megapolis' benefits and the ability to pay for them largely explain the high wellbeing of middle-aged citizens. Several researchers have found that subjective wellbeing linearly decreases with age in many countries, while the -shaped curve is confirmed only in wealthy western countries . But some researchers have not found a -shaped curve even in these countries . Apparently, conflicting  regarding age-related patterns can be explained in terms of the well-being measurement dominants: whether the studies focus on the rational cognitive aspects of assessment  or emotional well-being  . It is also necessary to consider regional characteristics and the conditions of the physical living environment in age-related patterns.\n\nDuring the analysis, we did not find any significant gender differences in the well-being of citizens. As Diener with co-authors rightly pointed out in their review of research on subjective well-being, gender differences are not universal. These differences are usually small, and they depend on cultural values and conditions of gender equality/inequality in societies .",
        "11": " . s \n\nA megapolis, a concentration zone of all types of resources , has an ambiguous influence on the quality of life and well-being of its residents. It is obvious that converting the \"wealth\" accumulated by the megapolis into an attractive living environment is becoming the primary management task for municipal and federal authorities. An effective solution to this problem requires the development of measurement indicators and  for conducting urban wellbeing studies suitable for modern urban realities. The  of such studies are of practical importance for making informed management decisions in urban restructuring planning, urban infrastructure upgrades, and the development of social policy measures aimed at improving the quality of life and well-being of citizens. In our further research on the well-being of megapolis residents, we intend to expand the range of assessment indicators and unify measurement procedures, include in-depth study of individual socio-demographic groups in order to clarify the elements of urban infrastructure that are most important for each group, and conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for resident dissatisfaction with certain aspects of life."
