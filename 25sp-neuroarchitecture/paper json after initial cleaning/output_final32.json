        "3": " \n\nResearch links the built environment to health outcomes, but little is known about how this affects quality of life  of African American breast cancer patients, especially those residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Using latent trajectory models, we examined whether the built environment using Google Street View was associated with changes in QOL over a -year follow-up in  newly diagnosed African American breast cancer patients. We measured QOL using the RAND -Item Health Survey subscales. After adjusting for covariates, improvement in emotional well-being and pain over time was greater for women living on streets with lowquality  sidewalks.",
        "4": " . \n\nDespite the fact that health, disease, and quality of life  occur in physical and social contexts, research has often been characterized by explaining health-related outcomes exclusively in terms of individuallevel, personal characteristics. Research links neighborhood conditions  to health and well-being , but little is known about how such neighborhood conditions affect cancer patients' QOL, including those with breast cancer. With nearly four million breast cancer survivors expected to be living in the United States by   and the growing number of breast cancer survivors due to improvements in early detection and breast cancer treatment , increasing attention has focused on breast cancer patients' health-related QOL and its survival implications. A cross-sectional study of Black and Latina breast cancer patients  years following diagnosis found that neighborhood stress was associated with poor patient self-rated health. And although a recent review identified important effects of the social and\nbuilt environment on breast cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, and prognosis, studies focusing on QOL were notably absent.\n\nSome evidence supports the general importance of neighborhood conditions, and especially the built environment, in shaping the aging experience and health trajectory of late middle-aged adults. Late middle-age is a time of life when many are retired or considering retirement. Older adults spend more time in their immediate neighborhood than younger adults and may rely more on their neighborhood for services and amenities and on their neighbors for social contact and support. Disadvantaged neighborhoods may adversely affect older adult's psychosocial well-being through stressors in the physical environment, lower access to economic and medical resources, and a non-cohesive social environment. Residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods may feel suspicious and distrustful of others, and thus tend to keep to themselves, resulting in feelings of social alienation, a sense of powerlessness or loss of control, increased stress, and incident or worsening depression. In contrast, neighborhoods that are conducive to social integration and support may provide older adults with a positive identity and a sense of\n\n\n:    a Corresponding author.\n    E-mail address: mario.schootman@ssmhealth.com .\npurpose. Understanding the link between neighborhood conditions and QOL outcomes among older adults has become increasingly important , especially among patients who reside in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nFor African Americans who reside in disadvantaged urban neighborhoods, exposure to adverse neighborhood conditions may explain some observed racial disparities in health outcomes. The disparities in breast cancer incidence and prognosis between African American and White breast cancer patients are well known , and African American breast cancer patients have reported lower scores on many aspects of their QOL than other racial/ethnic groups. However, few studies have examined associations between neighborhood conditions and QOL in urban-dwelling, middle-aged and older African American adults, and no such studies have been conducted in African American breast cancer patients. This study examined how the built environment affected changes in QOL over time in newly diagnosed African American breast cancer patients.",
        "6": " .. \n\nAfter Institutional Review Board approval at Washington University School of Medicine, we recruited newly diagnosed African American breast cancer patients to participate in a randomized controlled trial  of a behavioral cancer-communication intervention using a touchscreen tablet-computer .  Patients diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ  or non-metastatic, invasive breast cancers  were enrolled between December  and December . Patients were identified with the help of their treating physicians at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine or at Saint Louis University School of Medicine, both in St. Louis, Missouri. Patients were randomized either to standard of care for their breast cancer treatment  or to the intervention arm, which received standard of care plus the tablet computer containing videos of African American breast cancer survivors relating their stories about living with breast cancer . The survivor-stories video program featured  video clips focusing on coping, social support, healthcare experiences, follow-up care, QOL, and treatment side effects . The program featured short  stories told by  different African American breast cancer survivors and covered  breast cancer topics. The touchscreen tablet-computer allowed for story selection either by topic or storyteller. Patients were eligible to participate in the RCT if they were  years of age, spoke English, had no prior history of breast cancer, did not plan a bilateral mastectomy, and did not demonstrate cognitive impairment on the Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, administered to women  years of age.\n\nFollowing informed consent, patients completed five telephone or in-person interviews using a computer-assisted telephone interview system to collect demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and QOL data. The baseline interview  was planned to occur at the time of patients' surgical post-operative visit or start of neoadjuvant treatment, depending on the course of treatment, with follow-up interviews planned one month following baseline  and six ,  , and   months after definitive surgical treatment. The intervention was administered three times over the  year study: the first exposure after the baseline interview and the second and third exposures - weeks before the -month and -month interviews. Clinical data were collected by patient self-report and from the medical record.",
        "7": " .. n\nPatient-reported QOL was measured using the eight subscales  of the RAND -Item Short Form Health Survey ., created at RAND for the Medical Outcomes Study. Reliability and validity of the subscales have been established in studies of both general and patient populations , and general population norms for this instrument are available. The eight subscales are reliable measures of QOL across different racial groups. Standardized scores range from  to  with higher scores indicating better health perceptions.",
        "8": " .. \n\nHome address was obtained at each of the five interviews. Participants' residential addresses were geocoded with ArcGIS . . This geocoding allowed us to identify the street segment of each patient's residence for auditing the built environment. A street segment was defined as the section of the road between two consecutive intersections. Segments may vary by type of neighborhood.\n\nA specially trained study team member  used each participant's residential street address to complete the Active Neighborhood Checklist measuring neighborhood conditions through Google Street View  to assess the built environment. GSV has been found to be reliable and valid relative to the \"gold standard\" of in-person audits in urban areas using the Active Neighborhood Checklist. The checklist assesses land-use characteristics ; sidewalks ; shoulders and bike lanes ; street characteristics ; and quality of the environment for pedestrians . We selected the date of the GSV that was closest to and before the date of a participant's baseline interview. Validity of historic and more recent GSV imagery were similar compared to in-person field audits . Advantages of GSV include efficiency, researcher safety, low cost, unobtrusive data collection, and access to historical images of the same streets.\n\nWe examined five characteristics of the built environment of the street segment on which a patient resided. Mixed housing was present when a combination of single-family homes, multi-unit homes, or apartments was observed. Otherwise, the participant did not live on a street segment with mixed housing. We also assessed whether an abandoned building, home, or vacant lot was present or not present. A mixed-use variable was created to indicate whether or not a nonresidential destination was present or not on the street segment; nonresidential destinations included a grocery/convenience store, supermarket, food establishment, entertainment, library, post office, bank, dry cleaner, indoor fitness facility, park, off road walking trail, sports/ playing field, basketball/tennis/volleyball court, playground, outdoor pool, park with exercise or playground facilities, and designated green space. We also observed whether or not graffiti, broken/boarded windows, litter, or broken glass were present. Sidewalk quality was based on the presence of nine characteristics of high-quality sidewalks , including the presence of a buffer between the curb and sidewalk, sidewalk continuity within street segment, sidewalk continuity between street segments, width of sidewalks  feet, no missing ramps or curb cuts, no major bumps/cracks/holes, no permanent obstructions, tree shade, and flat/gentle slope. Having no sidewalk was\ncoded as  . A dichotomous variable was created, with  indicating poor quality or no sidewalk and  indicating high quality sidewalks on one or more of the nine characteristics.",

They included individual-level sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and treatment-related variables, psychosocial factors, and neighborhood-level data from the participants' census tracts. We also included the treatment arm to which patients were assigned in the latent growth curve models, since the study participants were part of a RCT designed to increase patients' QOL.\n\nPatient sociodemographics included age, marital status , education based on the number of years , employment status , and annual household income . We also asked for participants' residential address to determine whether participants moved after baseline.\n\nClinical and treatment-related variables included type of surgery , with or without radiation and/or chemotherapy in either the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Therefore, a categorical variable was created for the extent of treatment received . Cancer stage was determined by clinical staging in patients with locally advanced disease and by surgical pathology in patients with early-stage disease. Patients' smoking history , body mass index  computed in  using patients' height and weight collected by interview, and comorbidity, each measured at baseline, also were used. We used Katz's validated interview adaptation of the Charlson comorbidity index  to measure patients' history and presence of comorbidities; each condition is weighted with higher scores indicating greater comorbidity severity.\n\nPsychosocial factors included social support and depressive symptoms. Perceived availability of social support was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study  Social Support Survey , which is associated with QOL in breast cancer patients . The instrument includes  items using -point, Likert-scaled response options, with higher scores indicating greater perceived availability of social support. Among patients with chronic conditions, this measure has high discriminant and convergent validity. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale . The CES-D has good construct and concurrent validity and has demonstrated reliability in various populations. Scores on the CES-D range from zero to  , with higher scores indicating more severe depressed mood. For analysis, we compared patients with and without elevated depressed mood .\n\nNeighborhood conditions Population characteristics at the census-tract level were obtained from the - American Community Survey and consisted of economic conditions , racial segregation , and land use .",

A latent trajectory model, , was used to examine the change in each QOL subscale over time and factors that explained any\nobserved change in our African American breast cancer patient participants. All models were parameterized such that the intercepts indicated the average baseline levels of QOL subscales and the slopes denoted the trajectories of change in QOL subscales from the baseline to  months following definitive surgical treatment. Latent trajectory models were conducted using Mplus Version ..  Maximum likelihood method was used to accommodate non-normality and missing data. First, we estimated the relationship between the unadjusted slope and intercept of each QOL subscale. Second, we determined whether built-environment characteristics of the street segment of each patient's residence predicted the slope and intercept of each QOL. Third, we examined whether significant built-environment variables remained significant predictors of the slope and intercept of each QOL subscale after adjusting for individual-level variables and neighborhood conditions at the census tract. Individual-level and neighborhood-level variables that did not predict either intercept or slope of QOL were not included in the final models. The Z test was used to test whether each parameter estimate was significantly different from zero at the . level of significance.",

Additionally, data about the built environment could not be collected for  patients because GSV data was not collected by Google, thus, baseline descriptive statistics and built-environment data shown in Table  are based on  patients. There were no significant differences in the clinical, demographic, and psychosocial variables of interest as shown in Table  between the  patients included in this secondary analysis and the  patients whose built-environment data could not be collected using GSV. However, a greater percentage of patients included in our analysis lived in neighborhoods that had a greater percentage of Non-Hispanic African Americans  and of residents living below the poverty level  compared to the  patients for whom we could not collect GSV data. We found no evidence of selection bias based on the year when the GSV imagery was obtained for the study population or on the percentage of the population living below the federal poverty level.\n\nMost study participants were employed, had household incomes less than   of housing units were vacant.

        "13": " .\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the extent to which the built environment affected changes in QOL over time in a sample of newly diagnosed African American breast cancer patients. QOL improved over time for seven of the eight subscales and remained stable for one subscale, pain. Our findings showed that living on streets with high-quality sidewalks was associated with higher baseline emotional well-being and social functioning scores in adjusted models. Sidewalk quality was negatively associated with the slope for emotional well-being and pain in adjusted models. As emotional well-being and pain scores improved over time for all women, the negative estimates for these trajectories indicate that the improvement in these QOL scores was larger for women living on streets with poor-quality sidewalks than the improvement observed among women living on streets with highquality sidewalks. As previous work has shown greater mobility among older adults in neighborhoods with better sidewalks  as well as health benefits from walking outside , attention to the built environment, especially sidewalk quality, seems to be critical for understanding why QOL might, or might not, improve following a breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nOur data in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients showed that sidewalk quality at baseline was associated with improvements in emotional well-being and pain over a -year follow-up. While studies have examined neighborhood conditions related to QOL, few have been conducted in African American breast cancer survivors, and according to one review article, most studies have used a cross-sectional design . For example, perceived neighborhood stress and neighborhood social disorder were found to be associated with poorer self-rated health among ethnic minority breast cancer survivors. It is important to understand how sidewalk quality \"gets under the skin\" and can affect QOL. The mechanism through which sidewalk quality affects changes in QOL may include physical activity and BMI. Although BMI was not associated with trajectories of any of the QOL subscales, and was not included as a confounder in our models, physical activity after diagnosis could be a mechanism through which sidewalk quality affects change in\nboth QOL subscales, as even moderate levels of physical activity  was observed to have survival benefits after a breast cancer diagnosis . Additional studies should be conducted to focus on the relevance of neighborhoods in promoting wellness and QOL among breast cancer survivors. Because QOL is associated with survival , and African American breast cancer patients have poorer survival than other racial/ethnic groups , it is important to identify ways to improve QOL in African American patients. Unfortunately, our computer-based can-cer-communication intervention using African American survivor story videos did not affect QOL trajectories.\n\nStrengths of our study include its longitudinal design as part of a randomized controlled trial to examine effects of the observed built environment on African American breast cancer patients' QOL. We used GSV, which has been found to yield valid and reliable information about the built environment. Advantages include efficiency, researcher safety, low cost, unobtrusive data collection, and access to historical images of the same streets. By not using self-reported data about neighborhood conditions, potential bias is reduced. In addition, we focused on AfricanAmerican women only who often report lower scores on many aspects of their QOL than other racial/ethnic groups. Moreover,  percent of enrolled women completed all five interviews, reducing the likelihood of selection bias.\n\nWe also recognize the limitations of our study. Our participation rate for enrollment into the study included \\% of  eligible patients identified, yet this percentage is similar to the number of African American women enrolled in a prior longitudinal QOL study of patients with early-stage breast cancer and age-matched controls. Although participants and nonparticipants did not differ significantly by marital status or insurance type, non-participants were an average six years older than participants. Another limitation is that we did not have data on the street addresses of study participants prior to their enrollment in the study. Neighborhood conditions and life experiences over a woman's life course prior to a breast cancer diagnosis may affect various health outcomes. We only found a significant association between sidewalk and the QOL trajectory over time. A possible explanation is because the prevalence of other built-environment factors was too low to show an effect on the QOL trajectory in this sample. Future studies with larger samples are needed to further examine the associations between those other built-environment factors and the QOL trajectory. In addition, we only audited the street segment of each study participant's residence. Although this limited geographic area that was audited does not capture the entire neighborhood of study participants , our study shows important associations of the built environment with changes in QOL in very close proximity to where participants lived. Because adjacent street segments tend to have similar characteristics , our findings likely extend beyond the street segment of the participants.\n\nIn , sidewalk quality was associated with changes in emotional well-being and pain QOL measures in newly diagnosed African American breast cancer patients. The improvement in these QOL scores over -year follow-up was larger for women living on streets with poor-quality sidewalks than the improvement observed among women living on streets with high-quality sidewalks. The extent to which highquality sidewalks can promote mobility and healthy aging is important , as even a small amount of habitual walking outside the home has health benefits."
