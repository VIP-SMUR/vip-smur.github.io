        "3": " \n\nBACKGROUND: Different land cover types in cities, including green areas, have impacts on mental health. Few studies, however, have been conducted in megacities in low-/middle-income countries, which have extremely complex urban arrangements. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed land cover using the population database of the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey  and the associations with the diagnosis of depression/anxiety. METHODOLOGY: Automatic classification of the orthophotos of the metropolitan area was performed using the random forest algorithm to provide land cover variables. The association of mental health data with land cover was determined with logistic regression and multilevel regression models. : The percentage of different green spaces, mainly grassed areas, within districts was negatively associated with the presence of anxiety , while roofs, asphalt and shadow  were positively associated with the presence of anxiety. These  were more significant in green areas within the fourth quartile  and -. , respectively] and in the roofs in the fourth quartile . No significant  were found for depression. SIGNIFICANCE: Our data indicate the need for intensive greenery in spaces with different vegetation compositions in urban environments, especially megacities, to improve the mental health of urban dwellers.\n\n\n Urbanization; Public health; Green urban areas; Land cover",
        "4": " INTRODUCTION\n\nNumerous ecosystemic, economic and health benefits of the presence of vegetation in urban environments have been reported. The environmental benefits of green spaces in cities include improved air quality, esthetics, shadow production, thermal control  and carbon storage . Qualified green areas in urban spaces are believed to encourage physical activity, reduce stress, increase resilience  and improve social interactions .\n\nSeveral studies have reported an association between the presence of green areas and better mental health, especially regarding depression and anxiety . In , Olmsted recognized that the presence of green spaces could improve human health. In the book Public parks and enlargement of town, he reported that urban parks could improve city people's physical health by providing open spaces with trees, sunlight, and fresh air .\n\nEarlier studies relating to green spaces and mental health reported that patients recovering from cholecystectomy in a Pennsylvania hospital in a room with a window view of the natural setting had fewer complaints than those facing a gray wall . Ulrich's work was based on environmental psychology, and the stress reduction theory, as well as Kaplan and Kaplan's attention restoration theory, were relevant to further studies of landscape design in urban spaces .\n\nMost studies of green spaces and health outcomes have been conducted in high-income countries in North America and Europe . The profound social and geographical disparities of megacities in low/middle-income countries   might influence the interactions between land cover and people's health differently from the interactions in high-income countries. In the few available studies conducted in LMIC, the  have suggested that the benefits of green spaces were even greater among people in lower socioeconomic classes . Less is\nunderstood about the amount of green space needed to promote these health benefits .\n\nA cross-sectional study conducted in four European cities with  participants  demonstrated that more time spent visiting green spaces was associated with better selfreported mental health . Astell-Burt et al. in a longitudinal study with , adults , associated larger amounts of green spaces close to residences with a lower risk of psychiatric disorders, according to the General Health Questionnaire . Ward Thompson et al. associated increased exposure of adults to green areas with decreased daytime salivary cortisol levels as a biomarker of stress.\n\nIn addition, mental health status can be influenced by urban settings . A study addressing land cover and mental health in nurses in the city of El Paso, Texas, observed that depression increased with grayness  and decreased with brownness  . There have been few studies addressing the relationship between different land cover classes and mental health in LMIC megacities.\n\nThe Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area  has ca.  million inhabitants  in an area of . The SPMA has a very irregular distribution of green areas  and similar characteristics to other LMIC megacities, such as unplanned urban growth, housing shortages, a lack of infrastructure, and violence/insecurity in the lower socioeconomic status areas .\n\nA previous report from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey  indicated an extremely high prevalence of common mental disorders in Sao Paulo. Almost \\% of the participants living in the SPMA experienced mental disorders in the  months prior to the interview, which is a higher percentage than those reported by similar surveys conducted in other countries . It is unknown whether residential greening or housing density have any effects on the mental health of this population, and few studies have addressed this issue in LMIC megacities . Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of land cover with the presence of anxiety and depression in the SPMA.",
        "6": " The data are from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey , a population-based cross-sectional survey of psychiatric morbidity that evaluated a probabilistic sample of household residents in the SPMA aged  years and over. Participants were selected from a stratified multistage-clustered area probability sample of households, covering all  municipalities of the SPMA, without replacement. A total of  individuals were interviewed, with a global response rate of . The data were collected between  and . In this study, due to missing data after georeferencing ,  participants were analyzed.",
        "7": " Assessment of psychopathology\n\nParticipants were interviewed face-to-face using the World Mental Health Survey version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, a fully structured lay interview that generates diagnoses according to the DSM-IV criteria designed to be used in epidemiological and comparative studies of psychopathology. For the present report, depression included the diagnosis of major depressive disorder and dysthymia. Anxiety includes generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder, specific phobia, social phobia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The methodology used in this survey was not developed for the assessment of neurodevelopment disorders and psychotic conditions since it would imply affirmation by clinical reevaluation.",
        "8": " Physical diseases comorbidities\n\nPreexisting physical disorders were assessed with a standard chronic disorders checklist. The comorbidity index was calculated as the sum of the following disorders: cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, cancer, diabetes, digestive disease, respiratory disease, arthritis, musculoskeletal disease, migraines, and hypertension. In this population, the presence of comorbidities, especially chronic pain, has previously been shown to be associated with the diagnosis of mood/anxiety disorders .",
        "9": "Demographic data included age, sex, marital status, and educational level.\n\n- The educational level was divided into four categories according to the number of completed years of education as follows:  years: none/some primary education; - years: some/completed primary education; - years: some/completed secondary education; and  or more years: some/completed college or university.\n- Marital status was classified as married/cohabitating, separated/ widowed, and never married.\n\nIn this study, we considered educational level as a proxy for socialeconomic status due to known bias in Brazilian studies when collecting income data.",
        "10": "\n\nThis study was conducted in the SPMA, located at  south,   west, with a humid subtropical climate  according to the KöppenGeiger classification system . It occupies an area of  and has a density of  inhabitants . It comprises  municipalities, including São Paulo city, with  districts.",
        "11": " Land cover classification\n\nThe orthophoto from  had a spatial resolution of  m with three spectral bands: near infrared , blue, and red. The land cover classification was performed using the random forest algorithm . The method of classification using random forest was previously described in . Images were classified using the following land cover classes: tree canopy, grass, bare soil, cement floor, swimming pool, shade, white roof, gray roof, ceramic roof, dark roof, asphalt, and river/lake . We considered tree canopies and grass as green spaces and white roofs, gray roofs, ceramic roofs, and dark roofs as roofs for data analysis. It is important to note that the class called grass included all herbaceous land cover.\n\nThe false-color composite scheme was used to allow vegetation to be easily detected in the image. In this type of false-color composite image, vegetation appears in different shades of red depending on vegetation types and conditions due to its high reflectance in the NIR band . The orthophoto false-color composition used in this study was R  = NIR band, G  = red band, and B  = blue band.\n\nThe classification accuracy was determined using an error matrix, the Kappa index, which indicates the presence of misclassification. The thematic maps used in this study had Kappa values equal to or above , which is considered an accurate classification according to Landis and Koch .\n\nGreen space exposure assessment. We use land cover as an indicator of exposure to green spaces. Land cover was assessed within a  m radius buffer , a  m radius buffer  and within the district or municipality around each residence of the study participants.",
        "12": " For each buffer, municipalities of the SPMA and districts of São Paulo city are presented as the mean  and the minimum and maximum percentage of all land cover classes.\n\nWe performed logistic regression analyses to identify the association between land cover and meeting the diagnosis for anxiety and depression. Land cover data were analyzed in the  m buffers,  m buffers,  municipalities, and  districts of São Paulo city in the SPMA. Binary logistic regression was used for dichotomous dependent\n\nvariables. The significance level was set at . Data are presented as odds ratios . Model  was crude; model  was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, namely age, gender, education level, and marital status; and model  was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, namely age, gender, education level, marital status, and morbidities.\n\nHealth and land cover data were also analyzed using multilevel regression models to test whether the socioeconomic characteristics of neighborhoods affect the association between the presence of green areas and health outcomes. In multilevel models, individuals were included in the first level of the model and the contextual characteristics of the neighborhoods in the second level.\n\nFor the multilevel analyses, we use the land cover in quartiles to obtain  about land cover among the factors impacting health. We divided the land cover into quartiles as follows :\n-Q - The lowest land cover percentage within  of the population;\n-Q - The following lowest land cover percentage within  of the population ;\n-Q - The second highest land cover percentage within  of the population ; and\n-Q - The highest land cover percentage within  of the population.\nAll of the models were constructed using each land cover variable separately to avoid multicollinearity. The new variable green space was calculated as the sum of trees and grass and the variable roofs as the sum of all roofs of different colors.",
        "13": " \n\n\nA boxplot of land cover variables in the -m buffer , -m  buffer and districts/municipalities  is\npresented in the supplementary material. Descriptive analyses of the land cover variables are also presented in the supplementary material .\n\nRoofs were subdivided by color due to their color pixel and spectral signatures. We observed that these colors corresponded to different land occupations: ceramic roofs were more frequent in wealthy neighborhoods, white roofs were observed in industrial areas, and dark/gray areas corresponded to more densely built parts of the city . Therefore, we decided to use each roof type and color as a variable in the study.\n\nWe found associations between some types of land cover and the presence of anxiety  within the Sao Paulo districts/ municipalities but not within the buffers. Tree canopies, grass, and green spaces were negatively associated with the presence of anxiety , while roofs , asphalt, and shadow  were positively associated with the presence of anxiety. A figure showing maps of districts/municipalities of the SPMA and their classifications within quartiles of land cover is shown in Fig. .\n\nFigure  illustrates the  of the multilevel regression analyses, where land cover uses were divided into quartiles. The percentages of grass and green spaces in the th quartile were inversely correlated with the presence of anxiety  and -. , respectively) at the districts/municipalities level. The third quartile of the percentages of shadows and asphalt was positively associated with the presence of anxiety . The percentage of roofs and shadow in the fourth quartile was positively associated with the presence of anxiety .\nFemale gender, more years of study, being separated or widowed, and having more morbidity were positively associated with the presence of anxiety .\n\nAll of the  of the logistic regression models for the associations meeting the diagnosis of anxiety  or depression  and land cover variables are presented in the Supplementary material. The  of the multilevel regression models divided into quartiles for the  m buffer and  m buffers are also presented in the Supplementary material .\n\nWe did not find any positive or negative associations between depression and the land cover variables .",
        "14": "\n\nIn this study, we analyzed different land cover, including green areas, and its associations with the diagnoses of depression and anxiety in SPMA, Brazil. In this population with a prevalence of  anxiety, green spaces were weakly and inversely correlated with the presence of anxiety, whereas the percentages of roofs, asphalt, and shadows were positively associated with this diagnosis. Multilevel analysis showed that this positive effect of green spaces was present in the population living in areas within the fourth quartile of green cover, i.e., above  green cover. Areas within the third and fourths quartile  of roof densities had positive associations with the diagnosis of anxiety. No associations were found with the diagnosis of depression with any type of land cover examined. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the relationships between land cover, green areas, and the diagnoses of depression and anxiety in an LMIC megacity.\n\nWe assessed the percentages of the different land cover using  and  buffers and districts/municipalities, but we only found associations within the boundaries of the district/ municipality. Given the complexities of megacity urbanization, with irregular distribution of green areas, multitudes of land covers, and the high mobility of dwellers due to unequal distribution of services, it is possible that the health-associated ecosystem services provided by green spaces were not felt within smaller perimeters of a given individual. Accordingly, a Dutch study found that the percentage of green space  within  km and not within  km of residents' homes had an effect on improving mental health .\n\nThe mechanisms by which green areas promote good mental health are diverse. Whereas urbanicity is associated with increased mental disease, especially in LMICs , surrounding greenery decreases stress. Another study showed that these effects are independent of green area-induced physical activity and socialization , affirming the theory of stress reduction by Ulrich et al.  Indeed, exposure to more green space was associated with decreased cortisol levels  in the study by Roe et al. In our study, we were not able to determine whether individuals used more green spaces for leisure or physical activities or simply had greener views in their surroundings. It is interesting to note that other studies found a beneficial relationship between open spaces and the presence of anxiety . Considered together, these data suggest that urban planners should consider creating green spaces with different layers of vegetation, including open spaces, preferably associated with a restorative design .\n\nWe did not find an association between land cover and the presence of depression. The diagnosis of depression by the DSM-IV places a group of heterogeneous depressive conditions under the same umbrella under the label of \"Major depression or Dysthymia: from depression with different levels of severity and subtypes such as melancholic depression and atypical depression\". It is possible that analysis by depression subtypes\n\n\n\nData from the São Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey.\ncould have shown a difference, but this analysis was not within the scope of this study and could be a suggestion for further studies.\n\nInterestingly, in our study, the random effect of districts/ municipalities showed that the positive association of green spaces was higher in areas with increased percentages of grass and not in those with increased percentages of trees. São Paulo has homicide rates per , habitants that vary in different districts and cities, with districts that have rates as high as  . Therefore, the fear of violence in unregulated green areas might hinder their use by the population, a situation commonly felt in São Paulo. Fisher and Nasar suggested that dense vegetation in unregulated green areas could promote crime by providing criminals with a place to hide themselves or illegal goods . Wolfe and Mennis, in contrast, demonstrated that vegetation abundance was significantly associated with lower rates of assault, robbery, and burglary but not theft . Other studies have also observed that green spaces and vegetation could play a protective role against urban violence, but these studies were performed in developed countries, which have substantially lower\n\nA - Poor and unregulated neighborhood classification\n\nB - Industrial neighborhood classification\n\nC - Wealth neighborhood classification\nrates of violence and better regulation of wooded green areas than Sao Paulo . The complex situation between the use of wooded areas and violence levels in LMIC megacities might explain the differences between our  and those obtained in developed countries.\n\nWe found that larger amounts of asphalt, shadow, and roofs were positively associated with anxiety. The random effects of district/municipalities support that areas within the third quartile had the strongest positive association. Our data confirm that more urbanized areas might have increased the presence of anxiety. Larson et al. observed that children with autism spectrum disorder have more anxiety when surrounded by more urbanized spaces . Urban areas had higher rates of prescriptions of psychotropic medications for anxiety, depression, and psychosis than rural areas in a study across Scotland . Alcock et al. studied the impact of home relocation to a greener  urban area using the British Household Panel Survey. The  suggested that improved mental health after moving to greener areas was observed within a year .\n\nIt is noteworthy that, in this study, the association of green areas with anxiety was higher in areas with substantial green cover, i.e., located outside the expanded city center, with legally preserved green areas due to their water sources. These data note the necessity of intensive greenery in megacities to achieve substantial benefits regarding health parameters and the urgent need to preserve these areas, which are currently endangered by unplanned urban expansion . Indeed, the WHO recommended having green spaces larger than . ha within  linear meters of each citizen to obtain quantifiable health-associated benefits, a situation particularly uncommon in the city center of Sao Paulo .\n\nThis study had certain strengths, including using questionnaires certified by psychiatrists to assess the diagnoses of common mental disorders, rather than self-reports of mental health . As an important limitation of this study, we did not consider the access or usability of green spaces, such as parks and squares, which could improve mental and general health. However, other studies did not find effects of access on mental health . We calculated vegetation density through aerial measures and not by\n\neye-level measures. This fact certainly provides different perceptions about green spaces than aerial level measures . We found that, for some roof colors, the third but not the fourth quartile had significant associations with the diagnosis of anxiety. We do not have a clear explanation for this finding, but the data dispersion was much greater in the th quartile, which might have influenced the statistical . Analyzing the size and the fragmentation index of green areas could have explained the\ndiffering  between the buffers and districts/municipalities. We have not considered the uncertain geographic context since we did not have knowledge of the actual area, which might have influenced the psychiatric outcomes and the time and duration in which individuals experienced these influences . Such information is currently difficult to obtain in larger studies and raises ethical concerns related to privacy and data confidentiality .",
        "16": "\n\nThe presence of anxiety in a megacity of an LMIC was associated with increased density of the urban built environment. Our data also show that living in areas with the greenest spaces and with a lower stratum of vegetation presented a protective association for the presence of anxiety in this urban setting. It remains challenging to substantially increase green areas in densely populated areas of megacities to achieve substantially better health outcomes."
