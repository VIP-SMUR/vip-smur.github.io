        "4": " \n\nPrevious studies have identified the benefits of exposure to green or historic environments using qualitative  and psychometric measures, but studies using a combination of measures are lacking. This study builds on current literature by focusing specifically on green and historic urban environments and using both psychological and physiological measures to investigate the impact of virtual exposure on well-being.  from the psychological measures showed that the presence of historic elements was associated with a significantly stronger recuperation of hedonic tone  and reduction in stress . However, the presence of greenness had no significant effect on hedonic tone or stress. In contrast, physiological measures  showed significantly lower levels of alpha activity  in occipital regions of the brain when participants viewed green environments, reflecting increased engagement and visual attention. In , this study has added to the literature by showing the impact that historic environments can have on well-being, as well as highlighting a lack of concordance between psychological and physiological measures. This supports the use of a combination of subjective and direct objective measures in future research in this field.\n\n\n green environments; historic environments; well-being; EEG; virtual exposure; restorative environments",
        "5": " . \n\nIt is vital to understand how exposure to different environments can impact mental well-being. Globally, citizens have poor mental health with around  of adults suffering from depression  and in the UK,  of people suffer from high levels of stress . Despite the benefits of living in urban settings, including increased work and social opportunities and access to services, research has found that living in an urbanised area can have a negative impact on mental health , and can be a risk factor for mental health conditions, including major depression and schizophrenia . This is a public health concern, given that  of the global population lives in urban settings .\n\nOn the other hand, the well-being-benefits of spending time in nature are wellknown . Importantly, according to the literature, exposure to urban green infrastructure can be beneficial for the health and well-being of urban populations . These benefits include stress reduction , positive self-reported well-being , improved cognitive function  and more. Therefore, there is growing consensus on the notion that incorporating natural elements in cities can be a successful strategy to improve mental well-being at the population level.\n\nFurther, exposure to certain environments through virtual  has also been found to be beneficial for well-being  and can lead to restorative benefits .\nViewing environments virtually can be beneficial for populations with limited mobility and access to real environments  or in clinical settings, and it is also an important tool in researching the benefits of exposure to different environments .\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, benefits from natural environments have been explained by several psychological theories . Attention Restoration Theory  explains exposure to natural environments as being a restorative experience, allowing for the recovery of directed attention and mental restoration . Natural environments allow for attention to be captured in a 'softly' fascinating way but do not deplete attentional resources . Further, Stress Recovery Theory  states that exposure to natural environments can allow for recovery from stressful situations .\n\nSome studies have shown that built settings without the presence of traffic, and with no nature, can also be restorative and support mental well-being. These include squares , streets , open built spaces , and museums . From a theoretical perspective, these benefits can also be explained by ART. According to ART, any environment which presents the restorative properties of being away, fascination, compatibility and extent can offer restorative benefits . Historic environments have emerged as a specific typology of built places which have a high restorative potential . Numerous studies have suggested that historic places, including houses of worship , museums  and historic urban spaces  can support mental well-being and restoration.\n\nAccording to the evidence, these potential benefits from exposure to historic environments are due to two types of characteristics. First, the objective characteristics of historic buildings, including the geometry, can contribute to restoration , with nature known to encompass a rich fractal content  which can lead to 'effortless looking', as explained by ART  and reduce stress . This fractal fluency, and 'effortless looking' can occur in built and historic environments, as well as natural environments , and it is the fractal elements which are used to design architecture in the first place . Second, subjective, top-down features might also explain the mental well-being benefits of exposure to historic settings. Perceptions, associations and memories related to cultural identity and spirituality triggered by historic buildings can support restorative experiences and positive affective outcomes . Exposure to environments which present both natural and historic elements might be especially beneficial for mental well-being, as green and historic environments might be, at the same time, quiet and interesting. In line with this idea, previous research found mental well-being benefits in historic cemeteries , a rural monastery , and a cathedral courtyard .\n\nPrevious studies attesting to the well-being benefits of exposure to historic settings employ qualitative  , psychometrics , and surveys and perceptual scales . However, there is a lack of studies examining physiological measures and/or a combination of psychometric and physiological measurements. Physiological outcomes have the advantage of providing an objective and precise measure of participants' responses, which are not subject to participant bias in expression. Such measures include not only traditional physiological variables, such as skin conductance and heart rate but also electroencephalogram . The latter allows for the recording of brain activity and can detect stress and arousal . In addition, the combination of physiological and psychometric measures can provide a more complete picture and allow for the assessment of the extent to which they are aligned, and also if questionnaires provide concordant measures of participants' well-being. In a previous study, we used a combination of physiological and psychological measures to assess mental well-being when participants were exposed to natural green and blue environments, and a built historic environment . In this experiment, we found that all three environments were associated with well-being benefits, although there was no clear concordance between the physiological and psychological measures in terms of which was the most effective at improving well-being. This study showed the importance and relevance of looking at both subjective and objective outcomes, as they can provide different  which can influence recommendations made in the field of research.\nIn contrast, the current study assessed the impact of exposure to four urban settings with varying levels of green and historic elements, all protected from motor traffic, on mental well-being, also combining psychometric and physiological measurements. The first aim was to assess whether exposure to urban environments with green and historic elements and their combination, supported mental well-being. The second aim related to the agreement between the outcome measures used. The research questions posed for this study were:\n\nRQ: Does exposure to urban environments with green and historic elements, and their combination, benefit mental well-being?\n\nRQ: Do psychometric and physiological measurements agree when assessing the well-being benefits of exposure to different urban environments?",

The four conditions, green modern, green historic, non-green modern, and non-green historic, are described in Table . This design allowed us to estimate the effect of each characteristic  on mental well-being variables. At the same time, the design also allowed us to test for an interaction between green and historic environments.\n\n\n\nFour videos depicting urban traffic-free scenes, one per condition, were created for the experiment .

EEG is a reliable measure for detecting changes in brain activity during relaxing and stressful conditions . Measurements were recorded using a non-invasive cap with  electrodes, and electrode gel which was used to ensure low impedances. The electrode channels were connected to a QuickAmp amplifier. BrainVision Recorder   was used to record the data. A sampling rate of  Hz and a notch filter of  Hz was applied.

        "23": " . \n\nThe current study assessed the impact of exposure to green and historic urban environments on mental well-being with a combination of self-reported psychological and physiological  measures. The research questions that were posed were:  Does exposure to urban environments with green and historic elements, and their combination, benefit mental well-being?  Do psychometric and physiological measurements agree when assessing the well-being benefits of exposure to different urban environments?\n\nDescriptive analyses of subjective measures showed that exposure to all four nontraffic urban environments contributed to the recuperation of mental well-being after exposure to the traffic environment and that their restorative potential was comparable. However, among the four environments, the presence of historic elements was associated with a significantly stronger recuperation in hedonic tone and reduction in stress. This may provide evidence that exposure to historic elements is more beneficial than exposure to modern environments. In terms of mental well-being, historic elements can support mental well-being states, and these findings help to answer our first research question. The effect of historic environments supports and extends previous research which has shown the restorative potential of historic environments .\n\nOur  found greenness to not be a significant predictor of subjective well-being. This could be related to the fact that according to descriptive checks, more focus was placed on historic features even when greenness was present. The most popular descriptors chosen for the environments shown were more focused on the historic characteristics rather than the green elements, even when greenness was present . However, when participants viewed the green environments which lacked historic features, descriptors were chosen that were more focused towards greenness. This suggests that more focus was placed on historic features even when greenness was present, which supports the subjective findings that the main effect was from historic, as per our first research question. Also, it shows that greenness is potentially valued or noticed more in the absence of historic characteristics. However, regarding preferences for environments, participants were clearer about their preference for green spaces, with most participants preferring green to urban spaces. However, they were less decisive about their preferences for historic and modern spaces. A broader range of preferences was found for historic and modern spaces. This may suggest a potential mismatch between what is valued and what is beneficial for wellbeing. However, the current studies used urban environments that included both green and historic elements within an urban setting . Where more natural environments have been assessed, we have seen preferences for green environments, as has been reported by other authors assessing more natural green environments . Therefore, future research is required to assess the relative weightings of elements such as 'greenness' and historic components within a range of natural/rural, semi-rural and urban environments to assess the generalizability of the findings for promoting well-being through visual exposure or immersion.\n\nThe  from the objective measure  are not as simple to interpret, however, it can be highlighted that EEG is changing in response to viewing the different green/nongreen and historic/modern environments. The  showed that the presence of greenery\nwas significant for alpha power in the occipital region of the brain. Lower levels of alpha power were recorded when participants viewed environments with greenery compared to environments without greenery. Based on previous literature, this would indicate that participants were more engaged and visually attentive when viewing the green environments as alpha is a resting state and more abundant when the brain is relatively inactive, for example with eyes closed when not processing visual imagery in the occipital  cortex . This state could potentially be explained by the concept of 'soft attention/fascination' as described in ART , however, this is difficult to decipher and test experimentally with EEG. We might have expected an increase in frontal alpha when viewing environments that induce a relaxed state, which was not found in this study. Significant interaction effects  were also found for theta power in the lateral frontal and left frontal regions of the brain. This increase in theta power may be reflecting a state of relaxed attentiveness, which has been shown in previous studies . Furthermore, changes in EEG alpha and theta have reliably been found to be associated with relaxation and meditation , which may be concordant with our . Overall, regarding our second research question, although significant changes were detected, reflecting the sensitivity of the measures within the  employed, we have found that psychometric and physiological measures do not always align when assessing the well-being benefits of exposure to different urban environments.\n\nThis study has added to the literature by assessing both subjective and objective measures of well-being. The lack of agreement between the physiological and psychometric findings highlights the importance of using a combination of measures when researching the benefits that environments can have on well-being. It also demonstrates the complexity of EEG research and interpretation of data. The use of physiological measures within this field of research is relatively new, and more studies are needed to establish their use and clarify the interpretation of . This study has also provided a novel angle by focusing on green and historic environments and the combination of these elements, as well as highlighting the positive impact that exposure to urban historic environments can have on well-being.\n\nDespite interesting findings, this study has limitations. The  from this exploratory experiment should be interpreted with caution due to the imbalance in males and females, with most participants being female . Further, despite being reasonable for an EEG study, the sample size could have been larger which would have allowed us to assess specific sociodemographic characteristics which may have impacted the psychometric and physiological well-being outcomes. The use of a flat-screen as an exposure method in this study may have lacked immersiveness and influenced the effectiveness of exposure to environments in this study. Future studies should continue to investigate the impact of exposure to green and historic environments but adopt technology that provides a more immersive and realistic exposure, for example, virtual reality . By using VR, it would be possible to create an environment which combines both green and historic features and control and isolate features of these environments. Studies have started using VR as an exposure method and the findings lend weight to the technology as a superior exposure method compared to the use of flat-screen monitors . Additionally, qualitative research which highlights the green and historic environments, or features of these environments which are preferred, could be used in future research to inform and create virtual environments. Future research should continue to investigate the impact that exposure to urban historic environments can have on well-being, following the promising  of this study.",
        "24": " .  \n\nIn , the psychological analyses showed support for virtual exposure to historic urban environments having a beneficial effect on well-being, in particular, providing the recovery of hedonic tone and reducing stress after exposure to a stressor. The  from the physiological  measurements showed that brain activity changed as a function of viewing the different environments, but were less conclusive. More specifi-\ncally, the presence of greenery, compared with no greenery, was significantly associated with decreased alpha activity in occipital regions, which could be indicative of a more visually attentive and engaged state. Due to the complexity of the physiological findings, it is recommended that these  be interpreted with caution and replicated in future research, alongside other outcome measures. Future studies can build on these findings and consider using more immersive technology for exposure, e.g., VR, as well as recruiting large sample sizes with a more representative balance of sociodemographic characteristics  which would allow for subgroup analyses. This study has added to the literature by demonstrating, the impact that green and historic environments can have on well-being and the importance of including both subjective and objective measures when researching these environments."
