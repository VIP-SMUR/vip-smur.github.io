The paper presents a new conceptual framework that integrates and links together:  different sets of objective and perceived neighborhood characteristics,  different perspectives on SWB - hedonic, life satisfaction, and eudaimonic, and  mediating factors that explain how neighborhood characteristics influence SWB. These mediating factors are personal relationships, leisure activities, health, and neighborhood impact on emotions and mood. SWB can be a new powerful tool for planning and designing livable built environments and for evaluating the social sustainability of planning policies.",

        "7": " \n\nThe objective of this article is to offer a new conceptual framework that explains how the neighborhood built environment influences subjective well-being . Urbanization combined with global population growth is expected to add . billion urban residents by  . The number of mega-cities is increasing and many small cities are growing rapidly. As urban populations continue to grow, rural populations are expected to decrease. At the same time, migration flows alter the sociocultural composition of cities. All these changes highlight the need to focus on how cities will adapt to subsequent environmental and social challenges. One of the most important social challenges that cities face is to maintain or improve quality of life of their residents. Enriching people's lives is one of the goals of urban planning  and quality of life and happiness have emerged as important goals among policy-makers in urban planning .\n\nQuality of life, well-being, and happiness are concepts that are being used interchangeably  and can be assessed using objective or subjective indicators . Subjective measurement of quality of life is usually accomplished using SWB, a cognitive and affective personal evaluation of one's life . The most prevalent way to measure SWB is by using questions on life satisfaction. SWB indicators allow us to understand how people feel about their lives and what they consider important. Nobel\nlaurates Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen urged governments to consider subjective measures of well-being in parallel with traditional economic and social measures . SWB usage for public policy has also been strongly supported by various prominent scholars . Thus, SWB usage for public policy has been rapidly increasing. SWB is being measured nationally by several countries such as Australia, Bhutan, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Thailand, United Kingdom, and United States and is also being measured at an international level . Such is the current importance of SWB for public policy that the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development  has recently published extensive guidelines solely focusing on SWB measurement . Guidelines for SWB measurement have also been published by national governments such as United Kingdom .\n\nUsing  from SWB measurements, researchers have been investigating associations between SWB and aspects such as health, income, and personal relationships. The built environment is found to be an important predictor of subjective measures of well-being . To respond to challenges presented by urban population changes, it is crucial to investigate how the built environment influences SWB and then develop or adapt cities accordingly.\n\nA very common approach to studies related to the built environment is to examine it at a neighborhood level within metropolitan areas. A neighborhood is a geographical area that lies between the micro level of a dwelling and the macro level of a city or region. Neighborhood-level focus has been key to the field of urban planning since its early creation  and research shows that neighborhood planning is important for SWB . The neighborhood level is widely used as the scale addressed in public policy-making, in urban planning research, and in many related disciplines such as public health , child psychology , environmental psychology , and urban sociology . The neighborhood level is often the preferred option in urban studies because neighborhoods can be selected to present homogeneity in characteristics of interest. This allows detailed comparisons between areas with different characteristics in research related to urban planning. The neighborhood scale also allows meaningful comparisons within the same geographical and cultural context.\n\nSeveral previous theories exist on how cities influence aspects relevant to SWB from the field of urban sociology  and research has been examining the effect of city life on happiness . This literature suggests that living in big cities negatively affects quality of life and makes people less happy. However, since more and more people are living in cities, theories from the field of urban planning and urban design have been focusing on how to make cities more livable . Other theoretical works have been focusing on how specific types of urban development, such as urban sprawl, affect quality of life . Researchers have also been comparing happiness between different cities .\nYet, theories that systematically focus on the relationship of the built environment and SWB at a neighborhood level are scarce and insufficient. Neighborhood-level theories can be used for empirical studies related to urban planning issues in order to deeply examine urban environmental characteristics and their effect on SWB. Such an approach can aid our endeavors to plan and design happy cities  and can contribute to urban sustainability since SWB is part of social sustainability . The most relevant theoretical works are the conceptual models of Marans and Rodgers  and Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers . However, these conceptual models do not explain how and why neighborhood characteristics may influence SWB and they do not consider all aspects of SWB. These models as well as subsequent empirical studies are characterized by important conceptual and methodological weaknesses which will be analyzed in detail in the following section.\n\nThere is a need for a theory on built environments and SWB that focuses on a neighborhood level, includes all neighborhood characteristics and all SWB perspectives, and, most importantly, explains how these neighborhood characteristics may influence SWB. This paper contributes to knowledge by developing a new conceptual framework that aims to cover this need. The relationship between neighborhood planning and SWB is complex and indirect. Therefore, instead of simply focusing on identifying correlations between neighborhood characteristics and SWB, we need to unveil the underlying mechanisms that mediate this relationship. We also need to include all the dimensions of neighborhood characteristics and all the dimensions of SWB to achieve a more holistic and accurate portrayal of the phenomenon.\n\nIn accordance with these considerations, the framework presented here integrates and links together:  all potentially influential neighborhood characteristics,  all dimensions of SWB, and  mediating factors  that explain how neighborhood characteristics influence SWB. Understanding the role of neighborhood built environments in SWB is essential in order to clarify vague ideas about what is a livable built environment or a space of high environmental quality. This paper emphasizes that such a space is one that promotes SWB , one of the most important life goals across all different cultures .\n\nThe need for new conceptual foundations is explained in the next section. Then the new conceptual framework is presented and its benefits, limitations, and methodological implications are discussed. The last section discusses s.",
        "8": "  \n\nThe wider literature that evaluates the quality of the built environment at a neighborhood scale focuses on neighborhood satisfaction. In particular, the majority of studies quantitatively assess the impact of neighborhood characteristics on neighborhood satisfaction . The logic behind the focus on neighborhood satisfaction is that it is an important component of life satisfaction along with satisfaction with work, social life, and health among others. Thereby, neighborhood characteristics that improve neighborhood satisfaction promote life satisfaction and thus a part of overall SWB - since life satisfaction is a component of SWB.\nThere have also been attempts to link neighborhood characteristics with life satisfaction. Sirgy and Cornwell  develop and test a model connecting satisfaction with groups of neighborhood characteristics with life satisfaction. A second attempt  builds on the theoretical model of Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers  and links neighborhood design characteristics with residential satisfaction  and subsequently life satisfaction. Cao very accurately points out that previous studies in the field fail to reveal causal mechanisms behind this relationship. However, by using solely neighborhood satisfaction as a mediator between neighborhood characteristics and life satisfaction, his study also encounters challenges in explaining causalities.\n\nAll this literature is characterized by common theoretical and methodological problems as well as knowledge gaps. This paper argues that the importance of these problems and knowledge gaps raises doubts over the suitability of the dominant line of thought for studying the environmental quality of built spaces. Here are the identified issues.\n\nFirst, there is a problem using neighborhood satisfaction as a mediating factor between neighborhood and SWB. A neighborhood has a wide range of different characteristics influencing one's life in various direct and indirect ways. Residents may not consider a variety of life aspects, such as social life or health, influenced by the neighborhood's location and internal characteristics. They may not be aware of the enabling or constraining role of the built environment in their SWB and therefore their evaluations of neighborhood satisfaction may not adequately capture the influence of neighborhoods on SWB. Of course, neighborhood satisfaction is a useful indicator to obtain a general idea of residents' perception about a neighborhood but empirical studies should not restrict themselves only to this concept. As Hur and Morrow-Jones  also observe in the of their , a more complex approach is necessary for future studies. The few empirical studies that have focused on the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and SWB use neighborhood satisfaction as a mediating variable  or no mediating variables at all . Hence, they cannot strongly support causality nor explain the causal mechanisms behind the examined relationships.\n\nThe relationship between neighborhood characteristics and SWB is indirect. Let us consider neighborhood characteristics as  and SWB as Z. To support causality in quantitative cross-sectional research, we need to offer explanations on why and how  affects . In-between this relationship there exist several life aspects  such as activities or personal relationships. These life aspects are the ones directly influenced by the built environment and in turn contribute to SWB. They are the mediating factors between neighborhood characteristics and SWB. The present paper argues that these life aspects constitute the explanations of the role of the built environment in SWB. Researchers must consider them in order to understand causal mechanisms behind the examined relationships. This way, they can generate an accurate portrayal of the phenomenon and provide meaningful recommendations for planning practices.\n\nSomething that also hinders identification and understanding of causality on how neighborhood planning influences SWB is the lack of qualitative studies. Almost all relevant studies are based only on quantitative data and analysis. There are few exceptions such as Mitrany's  study that integrates qualitative material into an analysis on density and neighborhood satisfaction. Qualitative studies are necessary to support and explain causal relationships in urban planning related research  and especially since it is challenging\nto conduct longitudinal studies in this field. Regarding built environments and SWB, qualitative studies are essential to obtain insights into what are the mediating life aspects, how the built environment influences them, and how strong this influence is.\n\nAnother knowledge gap is the absence of other dimensions of SWB in previous studies and most notably the affective part that is a constituent in the basic definition of SWB. As stated above, there is no conceptual framework explaining how neighborhood characteristics can influence SWB in all its dimensions. The only relevant frameworks  link - but do not explain neighborhood characteristics with a cognitive dimension of SWB, life satisfaction. The importance of investigating all the dimensions of SWB is discussed in the next section. The absence of the affective part of SWB in previous studies leads to a lack of knowledge in two aspects:  the influence of neighborhood characteristics on emotions and mood  and  the importance of this interaction on the overall affect  and overall SWB.\n\nA final and equally important point is that many of the studies omit certain neighborhood characteristics that can be very influential. One common omission is the location of the respondent's residence in relation to other areas; for example nearby neighborhoods, facilities, the city center, and natural areas. Another frequent gap is missing data related to transport and travel. The location of a residence and the used transport modes can influence travel distances and accessibility to facilities and workplaces  and subsequently opportunities for leisure activities and social life. This way they can have an important impact on the residents'SWB. To accurately evaluate the quality of built environments, these characteristics must be considered in addition to other physical and sociodemographic characteristics of neighborhoods.\n\nIn , despite the existence of closely related theories and empirical studies, there is still a general lack of understanding of the complex relationship between neighborhood characteristics and SWB. Relevant literature does not examine sufficiently and systematically how such characteristics influence SWB. There is a need for a theory that does this, and therefore provides the necessary foundations for empirical investigations.",
        "9": "  \n\nTo respond to this need, the present study embraces a holistic approach to the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and SWB and aims to establish a framework that:\n\n- Includes all the potentially influential neighborhood characteristics\n- Focuses on all dimensions of SWB\n- Explains how neighborhood characteristics influence SWB using mediating factors",
        "10": " \n\nThe latest dominant trend in SWB empirical research is to distinguish between three types of SWB measures that correspond to different philosophical viewpoints. SWB measures are categorized as:  hedonic,  life satisfaction, and  eudaimonic. These are the three elements of SWB according to OECD's recent guidelines on SWB measurement . The distinction has also been recommended by several scholars in quality of life research\n. These three measures have been used in the largest SWB surveys such as the European Social Survey  and the worldwide Gallup survey on SWB and have been recommended by guidelines for relevant national studies . The present paper suggests that research focusing on built environments and SWB may benefit from incorporating all hedonic well-being, life satisfaction, and eudaimonia in their studies. Since these three views have distinct differences, it will be interesting to see if, and how, they are affected by built environments in different ways.\n\nAccording to OECD  guidelines on measuring SWB, its three components are defined as:\n\n- Hedonic well-being / affect: \"a person's feelings or emotional states, typically measured with reference to a particular point in time.\"\n- Life satisfaction/life evaluation:\"reflective assessment on a person's life or some specific aspect of it.\"\n- Eudaimonia:\"a sense of meaning and purpose in life, or good psychological functioning.\"\n\nAlthough SWB as a term is relatively new, the concepts that it encompasses have been around since ancient times. People have always been wondering and philosophizing what happiness is and how it can be achieved. A major debate on this subject is the Aristotelian eudaimonic view versus the Epicurean hedonistic one. Similarly, Graham  indicates the debate between the Aristotelian versus the Benthamite perspective since Jeremy Bentham was heavily influenced by Epicurus' hedonism.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the desired life is that of eudaimonia as opposed to just living well. A eudaimonic life is a fulfilling and meaningful life, a life where one takes advantage of her rational capabilities and develops aretēs . To achieve eudaimonia, Aristotle claimed that one may experience painful and difficult situations along the way. On the other hand, Epicurus suggested that the desired life for an individual is characterized by absence of pain, maximization of pleasure, and inner tranquility . Epicurus' viewpoint constitutes what we call hedonic well-being. Like Aristotle, he rejected the importance of wealth, power, and reputation to happiness. Epicurus did not consider Aristotle's virtues as unimportant. He suggested that virtues are a means that leads to the desired life, but they are not the end goal.\n\nNotable theories of modern times have also tried to identify what is the desired and meaningful life. Maslow  with his Hierarchy of Needs suggested that the ultimate goal in one's life is self-actualization - a view similar to Aristotle's. In order to achieve this, however, one must cover four other basic groups of needs beforehand. Expanding the views of Aristotle and Maslow which contrast with hedonistic life purposes, Ryff  proposes a concept for a meaningful life that she names psychological well-being. This consists of six main components: self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy, and positive relations with others.\n\nThe other perspective on SWB that has been widely used in research studies is that of life satisfaction . Life satisfaction is a way to cognitively assess one's life usually by evaluating several different domains such as personal relationships, work, income, health, and residence.\n\nContemporary philosophers and psychologists also make distinctions of SWB between hedonic well-being, life satisfaction, and eudaimonia. Haybron  makes the distinction between psychological happiness , prudential happiness (life\nsatisfaction), and perfectionist happiness . Sirgy  also agrees with this distinction in his book about subjective quality of life. Seligman  makes a very similar categorization of the pleasant life, the engaged life, and the meaningful life. A pleasant life seems in accordance with the hedonic philosophical views of Epicurus and Bentham. An engaged life seems in accordance with a satisfying life; where, besides feelings of pleasure, one feels satisfied with all aspects of life. A meaningful life is close to the eudaimonic views of Aristotle, Maslow, and Ryff.\n\nIn survey research, hedonic well-being is assessed with questions about positive and negative affect , life satisfaction with questions about how satisfied one is with life as a whole, and eudaimonia with questions about how meaningful one's life is or how worthwhile things in life are. Hedonic measures of SWB are related to the affective part of the brain and are concerned with reactions to certain stimuli. These reactions occur without cognition - thinking and awareness - and are expressed with positive and negative emotions and the experience of pleasure or displeasure. In contrast, life satisfaction and eudaimonia are cognitive evaluations of SWB and this is why there could be some overlap in responses to relevant questions. For example, one that feels satisfied with life may also feel that this is a meaningful life or the opposite. But this is not always the case. One may feel satisfied with all the domains in life but may be unable to find a meaning and purpose. Or one may experience a meaningful life because of certain fulfilling activities but may be dissatisfied with some life domains. Therefore, as suggested by current theory and practice, it is still very useful to assess all different viewpoints in SWB-related research.",
        "11": "  \n\nThis framework categorizes neighborhood characteristics that can influence SWB as objective - physical and sociodemographic - and perceived . Physical characteristics can be internal  and external . As supported by psychology and social science, a person's experience of a certain\n\n\nenvironmental attribute is based on perception. This study suggests that physical and sociodemographic neighborhood characteristics shape perceived characteristics such as perception of aesthetics, safety, opportunities for social life and leisure activities, and travel among others. These perceived characteristics subsequently influence various SWB determinants.\n\nHowever, in contrast with the conceptual models of Marans and Rodgers  and Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers  where only perceived characteristics influence life satisfaction via neighborhood satisfaction, there are examples of objective characteristics that can directly influence SWB determinants without the interference of perception. These are characteristics related to environmental pollution, for example noise and air pollution. They can directly influence emotions and mood as well as physical and mental health. Of course, very often these characteristics are perceived as well.\n\n\nIt is crucial to consider all sets of neighborhood characteristics and the relationships between them when trying to understand their effect on SWB. As already discussed, strictly focusing on one type or another may lead to false assumptions and s.",
        "12": "  \n\nThese neighborhood characteristics can influence SWB in different ways. They can influence various aspects of life that are important for overall SWB. It is necessary to identify these life aspects  and include them in relevant studies in order to unveil why certain urban planning practices may enable or hinder SWB and make suggestions on causalities from empirical . Let us consider an example of studying the impact of two neighborhoods on SWB. One neighborhood may positively influence certain SWB determinants such as leisure activities and negatively influence others such as health. And another neighborhood may have a different impact on these aspects. However, the total final outcome on overall SWB may be accidentally similar. Without knowing the impact on these SWB determinants, using this study for purposes of planning and policy-making would be challenging. On the other hand, if these SWB determinants are considered in the study, appropriate corrective measures can be recommended. They will aim to improve negatively influenced SWB determinants in these or other similar neighborhoods and therefore promote overall SWB in both types of neighborhoods.\n\nThis framework considers the SWB determinants that are influenced by neighborhood planning as:  personal relationships,  leisure activities,  neighborhood impact on emotions and mood, and  health. Personal relationships, leisure activities, and health are selected among the life domains that contribute to SWB . Neighborhood impact on emotions and mood is selected since it can obviously contribute to overall hedonic well-being but might\n\nFigure . Conceptual model showing possible causal relationships between neighborhood characteristics, SWB determinants, and SWB.\nalso influence the other two SWB dimensions. Of course, there are other important determinants of SWB such as job satisfaction but are not considerably influenced by neighborhood planning. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the selected four SWB determinants are influenced by neighborhood planning. Empirical studies show that neighborhood planning has a significant impact on personal relationships , on leisure activities , on emotions and mood , and on health .\n\nThis paper develops and presents a conceptual model showing the possible causal relationships between physical, sociodemographic, and perceived characteristics of neighborhoods, the four SWB determinants, and the three dimensions of SWB . Let us examine how the four SWB determinants mediate the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and SWB:\n Personal relationships is probably the most influential factor for a happy life . Theory suggests that measures such as ones that promote walkability and liveliness in neighborhoods may lead to better social life and potentially more opportunities for strong personal relationships. Research in urban design has provided important insights on how public spaces should be designed to promote social life . From a more general planning perspective, it is suggested that high density, mixed land uses, high street connectivity, and transit-oriented development can promote social life in cities. On the other hand extremely dense areas with high-rise buildings are thought to contribute to loneliness, fear of crime, and lower community spirit . To gain clearer and more concrete knowledge on this topic, it seems essential to empirically investigate\nhow planning practices influence social life and personal relationships and what is the importance of this influence to overall SWB. We must understand why and how physical and sociodemographic neighborhood characteristics create opportunities for socializing, for making new acquaintances or finding a partner. In addition to this, we need to understand why and how neighborhoods enable or hinder opportunities to interact with existing friends, family, or partners.\n Leisure activities are all the activities performed during time away from work, education, housekeeping, eating, and sleeping. They are activities that people do for pleasure or personal growth, therefore influencing SWB. Examples of leisure activities that could be influenced by the place where one lives are physical exercise and sports, cultural activities, hobbies, nature visits, and short trips. But not all leisure activities have a positive effect on SWB. There could be activities that have a neutral or even negative effect on someone's SWB, but are pursued because of the absence of opportunities for favorite leisure activities in close proximity. The availability, quality, and accessibility of options in close proximity can have a considerable impact on which leisure activities residents pursue. Another important factor that should not be neglected is the proximity to non-recreational facilities  and workplaces. The less accessible these places are, the more time residents spend on traveling and the less time remains for leisure activities.\n Neighborhood planning can also have an impact on emotions and mood. Built environments may cause negative emotions when they are unsafe, isolated, impersonal, extremely noisy, or considered of poor reputation. They can also cause negative emotions when excessive travel time is needed to reach destinations or when travel conditions are not the ones desired. Negative affective reactions may be additionally created when one feels that the necessary services and facilities for everyday purposes or for emergency purposes  are not in close proximity. On the other hand, built environments may create positive emotions when they are characterized by high aesthetic quality, when they integrate elements of nature such as trees and flowers, when they promote good neighbor relations and community spirit, or when interesting events occur in them. Place attachment may also play a role in emotions and mood . Places that people are positively attached to tend to create a feeling of familiarity and contribute to a pleasant mood; whereas new unfamiliar places could make people feel estranged or stressed.\n Among these four SWB determinants, health is probably the only one widely studied for its relation to the built environment . Neighborhood environments can directly influence physical and mental health via air pollution and noise. Accessibility to healthcare facilities can also play a role in good health. Besides, neighborhood environments can influence health indirectly in many ways. Emotions and mood changes caused by the built environment can have an impact on health. They could be either positive  or negative . Isolated places or dense but impersonal places can lead to feelings of loneliness and weak or non-existent personal relationships that, besides a negative effect on happiness, have a negative effect on health. Moreover, neighborhoods that offer opportunities for physical activity in close proximity can indirectly\npromote better health. Figure  explains these associations, where physical characteristics may directly influence health , whereas perceived characteristics indirectly influence health through personal relationships, leisure activities, and neighborhood impact on emotions and mood.\n\nAs seen in Figure , the outcome of the conceptual model is SWB. This variable of the model consists of the three views on SWB: hedonic well-being, life satisfaction, and eudaimonia. It would be interesting for empirical studies to investigate if and how these three views are distinctly influenced by neighborhood characteristics. Theoretically, only assumptions can be made on this. For example, neighborhood impact on emotions and mood could be more influential on hedonic well-being and not so important to eudaimonia. Since this impact has to do with emotions and mood, pleasure and painful feelings, it is directly pertinent to hedonic well-being. But neighborhood impact on emotions and mood could also be influential on life satisfaction. A considerably positive or negative affect may play an important role when one evaluates one of the components of life satisfaction that is satisfaction with neighborhood. The other three SWB determinants are also expected to be important to hedonic well-being and life satisfaction but it seems difficult to theoretically identify differences. The determinants that appear more pertinent to eudaimonia are leisure activities and personal relationships. These two can be influential for one's personal growth and self-actualization. However, it remains to be empirically examined if there is a significant impact of neighborhood characteristics on a meaningful life  or if it solely depends on other factors such as one's cultural , upbringing, personality, or opportunities for education.",
        "14": " \n\nSWB can be a powerful tool for urban planning. It is one of the basic end goals in life  or at least an important means to achieve other goals and it is currently emerging as a political goal in national scales. Veenhoven  explains exactly this, that the utility of happiness is twofold; both at individual as well as political level. Therefore, spaces and places that promote it are, at least partially, the answer to what is a \"good,\" a \"livable,\" or a \"high quality\" built environment. It appears logical as well as democratic to invite residents to give input on the built environment that makes them happy.\n\nApart from defining what livability is, SWB can greatly contribute to decision-making. It can be one of the major goals that planning policies are evaluated against in regard to their social sustainability. Planning policies can have diverse social effects on different actors making it challenging to reach well-founded decisions. By evaluating and understanding the impact of a planning policy on SWB and its determinants, decision-makers can shed light into conflicting social effects and improve the understanding of their decisions. For example, knowing that a planning intervention has been found to have positive influence on some SWB determinants and negative influence on others, but the negative is less important for overall SWB, could provide useful insights to be considered. Using the framework developed in this article, we could also assess the effects of environmentally sustainable planning on SWB. By doing this, we investigate synergies and conflicts between key environmental and social dimensions of urban sustainability.\nAfter a major review of relevant literature, Van Kamp et al.  point out that the field lacks a multidisciplinary theoretical framework explaining the connections between qualities of the built environment and human well-being. Since then, no complete relevant effort has emerged. The present paper aims to provide a framework in this direction. This framework can take a step further and move into interdisciplinarity. In particular, this paper suggests that a line of thought focused on SWB can offer an interdisciplinary platform for theory building and empirical research involving scholars and practitioners from various fields such as planning, design, public health, sociology, psychology, and urban geography.",
        "15": " \n\nBuilt environments influence SWB every day as well as in the long run. Especially in extreme cases, this influence can be immense. Let us consider cases of extremely isolated, extremely stressful, or extremely unsafe environments. For example, an extremely unsafe environment would pose a very negative effect on one's emotions and mood and would hinder opportunities for socializing and leisure activities. SWB would be very negatively influenced as a result of this. Though in less extreme, more usual cases, the importance of built environments on total SWB may be smaller. There is always this possibility because there exist so many other parallel drivers to SWB and also because people get partially adjusted to environments after a period of time. Even in that case, nevertheless, built environments can have a considerable impact on some SWB determinants so such studies still provide useful findings.\n\nThe framework presented here focuses on a neighborhood scale within metropolitan areas. Since a neighborhood lies between the micro level of a dwelling and the macro level of a city or region, it may not capture aspects that are more relevant to other scales - dwelling, city, region, country. Existing and future studies on all different scales are necessary to obtain the complete picture on the influence of the built environment on SWB. Limitations from a neighborhood-level approach are that a neighborhood is sometimes difficult to define geographically and may have different meanings for different people. In research studies, it is up to the researcher to define it according to the needs of the study.\n\nThe framework and the conceptual model of the study can naturally be disputed and modified either theoretically or empirically. And it is one of the purposes of this study to stimulate suchs and research activities. One may argue that there are other mediating factors between built environments and SWB or that the connections between the factors are different. Another may dispute the three views on SWB. Future theoreticals and empirical studies will offer the necessary insights to get a clearer portrayal of this complex phenomenon.\n\nFuture empirical studies can be based on either quantitative or qualitative data. Doing both is advisable to achieve a better understanding of the examined relationships. Quantitative data can be collected with questionnaires gathering residents' evaluations on neighborhood characteristics, the four SWB determinants, and SWB. An alternative or additional way to collect data could be smart phone based data mining . Data can be analyzed with structural equation modeling in order to test and, potentially, modify the proposed conceptual model. Otherwise, several regression analyses could be conducted assessing the influence of neighborhood characteristics on each of the four SWB determinants and on each of the three SWB perspectives separately. Qualitative data collected via in-depth interviews with the actual actors - the residents - shed light into\ncausal relationships, and also provide information about important neighborhood characteristics or SWB determinants not previously considered here.",
        "16": " \n\nSWB is widely considered as one of the main life goals and an indicator of social sustainability. Thus, it should be one of the ultimate goals when planning and designing cities. Previous theories do not explain sufficiently and systematically how neighborhood planning influences SWB. Closely related theoretical and empirical studies present certain weaknesses. The concept of neighborhood satisfaction, which is widely used in quantitative studies, is inadequate as a mediating variable between neighborhood and SWB. Relevant studies do not offer enough support and explanations of causal relationships because they do not consider appropriate mediating variables and are not accompanied by qualitative material. In addition, there is a complete lack of studies focusing on the affective part of SWB. Previous studies also often neglect to include in their analyses certain neighborhood characteristics that can be very influential on residents' life and overall SWB.\n\nThis paper has developed and presented a conceptual framework that explains how neighborhood characteristics influence SWB. The  of this study highlight the need: to unveil causal mechanisms providing explanations on why and how relationships are established, to investigate SWB holistically in all its dimensions, and to examine all sets of influential neighborhood characteristics. In response to this need, this framework explains how sets of objective and perceived neighborhood characteristics can influence four identified SWB determinants - personal relationships, leisure activities, neighborhood impact on emotions and mood, and health - that can in turn influence the three dominant subjective measures of well-being: hedonic well-being, life satisfaction, and eudaimonia. SWB can be a new powerful tool for planning and designing livable built environments and for evaluating the social sustainability of planning policies."
