       "Research using subjective wellbeing  measures finds that the greener an individual's local environment is, the higher the levels of happiness and the lower levels of stress they tend to report experiencing. This literature presents positive associations between existing large-scale green spaces, such as urban parks or squares, and the wellbeing of residents living in close proximity to them. In contrast, in the current work, we present a novel approach which combines SWB measures with photo simulation in order to examine the impact of street-level green infrastructure interventions on the people's perceptions of the SWB associated with urban sites. We tested the approach with the attendees of the 20th Biennale on Architecture and Urbanism in Chile in 2017, exploring the impact of four different types of street-level green interventions. The results indicate that all types of green interventions considered significantly increase the perceived happiness and reduce the perceived stress associated with the sites during short exposures, with varying effect sizes across different types and scales of interventions. The proposed technique could be used in urban planning processes to examine the potential SWB benefits of green infrastructure investments prior to their being rolled out.\n",

       "## 1. Introduction\n",
       "\n",
       "Over half of the world's population now live in urban areas and this proportion is predicted to grow rapidly over the next 30 years . While there are benefits to living in towns and cities compared to rural areas, including enhanced economic and social opportunities, a major downside of life in many urban areas around the world is the relatively low level of green space that residents have access to . In addition to the urban-rural divide, inequalities in access to green space exist within cities too: recent research indicates that those with low socioeconomic status have less access to high-quality green space in the Global North and to green space of any kind in the Global South than their economically better off counterparts . These inequalities go beyond green spaces and also apply to small-scale green elements such as the trees and shrubs . As towns and cities around the world grow to accommodate more and more people, a key priority for urban planners is the greening of urban spaces in ways that effectively promote the wellbeing of all residents.\n",
       "\n",
       "Capturing the value of greenery for the wellbeing of urban residents\n",
       "is central to efforts to encourage its provision. However, this is no easy task. First, like many other elements of environmental quality, such as air and noise pollution, elements of green infrastructure, including street trees, playing fields, parks and other open green spaces, are not typically bought and sold in markets . Second, wellbeing itself is a broad and multidimensional construct which covers how well individuals are doing in their lives across material, social, health and subjective dimensions . How best to operationalise wellbeing in order to examine how it is impacted by green space is, therefore, open to debate . It has been suggested that the resulting difficulties in assessing the overall value of urban green space are to blame for the widespread underinvestment in green infrastructure and the encroachment of urban sprawl into green spaces in cities around the world .\n",
       "\n",
       "Traditional approaches to valuing the benefits of green space have centred on using people's preferences as measures of their wellbeing, in accordance with a preference satisfaction account of wellbeing that says that people are well when they get what they prefer . Such approaches include both revealed and stated preference\n",

       "methods . Revealed preference studies look to how people behave in markets for related goods to infer their preferences for, and therefore the value of, green spaces. Hedonic price estimates, for example, are based on the premium associated with external non-market factors such as green space in related markets such as housing or labour markets . Stated preferences, on the other hand, bypass real markets and value green spaces based on what individuals say they would be willing to pay to access it, or willing to accept to forgo doing so, most often based on hypothetical scenarios . These standard methods have been critiqued, however, for failing to fully capture the wide range of positive health, ecosystem services and wellbeing benefits that green space gives rise to .\n",
       "\n",
       "In recent years, and in response to the challenges levelled at standard preference-based methods of valuation, researchers have begun to examine the benefits of green infrastructure using non-preference based measures of wellbeing. While some of this work has focused on documenting the links between green space and objective health and wellbeing indicators such as body mass index and cortisol levels , other work has looked to measures of subjective wellbeing  - individuals' own reports of how they think about their lives and feel as they go about them  - to investigate the value of green space. This work finds, for example, that living in a greener environment is linked to higher levels of life satisfaction and happiness and lower levels of stress .\n",
       "\n",
       "Of particular importance, is evidence from the literature using both objective wellbeing indicators and SWB measures which indicates that more green space is linked to lower levels of stress in deprived urban communities and that green space can act as a buffer for stressful life events . These findings suggest that access to green space may be of particular importance for the wellbeing of the most vulnerable in society. This evidence has strengthened the case for integrative sustainability policies which look to promote social as well as ecological sustainability in urban communities by greening urban spaces in ways that limit the potential risks of gentrification that green infrastructure investment can pose .\n",
       "\n",
       "While demonstrating the importance of green space for wellbeing, research using objective and SWB measures has had far less to say about how best to channel green investments so as to maximise their positive impact on urban residents. Additionally, with the exception of a few studies which have considered the impact of street-level green infrastructure, such as street trees, on residents' levels of neighbourhood satisfaction , the SWB work that does exist has tended to focus on large-scale green spaces with substantial land requirements . Understanding how to design small-scale green infrastructure in ways that can promote wellbeing is of particular importance in urban areas around the world where such infrastructure must be incorporated in built-up city areas where public land is costly and scarce.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the current work, and with a view to contributing to these gaps and expanding current techniques in green infrastructure planning and design, we use photo simulation in combination with SWB measures to study the impact of street-level green infrastructure interventions  on people's perceptions of the SWB\n",
       "associated with urban sites prior to their being rolled out. More specifically, we explore the impact of 'greening' tram lines, pedestrian streets, avenues and small streets on the feelings of happiness and stress that people associate with images of urban sites. Additionally, we compare our SWB results to those relating to a third outcome variable which has been considered in some of the existing photo simulation literature - individuals' perceptions of the safety of sites .\n",
       "\n",
       "We carried out the study with attendees to the 20th Biennale on Architecture and Urbanism in Chile in 2017. The results of the study indicate that all of the different types of green interventions we consider increase the average ratings of happiness and reduce the average ratings of stress associated with the images of the sites, with the magnitude of the impact varying across the different types and scales of green interventions. Moreover, we find that people's perceptions of safety are less consistently impacted by green interventions than are their ratings of SWB. Overall, the study demonstrates the benefits of using photo simulation in conjunction with SWB measures, in addition to more traditional measures like people's perceptions of safety, to compare and contrast the potential benefits of different types of green interventions.\n",
       "\n",
       "In what follows, we first review the existing literature on SWB and green space and the use of photo simulation in the urban planning literature. We then go on to present our new approach which builds on these two, thus far, separate bodies of literature.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1.1. SWB and green space\n",
       "\n",
       "SWB is an umbrella term for how people think and feel as they go about their lives . It includes both evaluative measures of SWB, such as people's overall evaluations of their lives and of domains of their lives such as their neighbourhood satisfaction, as well as experiential measures of SWB which reflect their affective experiences, such as the levels of happiness and stress they experience day to day . SWB measures have gained prominence in both economics and psychology over the past two decades and are now widely understood to provide valuable and reliable information about how individuals' lives are going . These measures are also increasingly being used to inform public policy. For example, many national statistical agencies, including those in France, Italy, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and Australia, are now collecting and using SWB data to monitor national wellbeing. In 2011, the UK government's Green Book - its guidance on cost-benefit analysis - was amended to include recommendations on the use of SWB measures in the valuation of non-market goods like green space .\n",
       "\n",
       "In recent years, a burgeoning body of literature has emerged which uses SWB measures to document the benefits of green infrastructure for individual wellbeing . Existing correlational evidence from this literature indicates that living in environments with higher levels of green space is associated with lower levels of depression, stress and anxiety , and higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction . For example, in a nationally representative longitudinal sample of UK residents, White et al.  find that, controlling for individual and regional covariates, individuals report both lower mental distress and higher life satisfaction on average when they live in urban areas with relatively high levels of green space. Krekel, Kolbe, and Wüstemann  find similar results when looking at the relationship between green space in urban areas in Germany, while also documenting a particularly strong positive relationship for older residents.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is also some experimental work which suggests that green infrastructure may have a causal impact on how people feel. For example, some small-scale work finds that incorporating natural elements"

Other studies compare the impact of walking in natural versus built-up environments, finding that walking in green space results in higher levels of happiness and lower levels of anger than doing so in built-up environments . All of this evidence suggests that policymakers should take seriously the potential wellbeing benefits of increasing the amount of green space citizens are exposed to in their daily lives.\n",

       "\n",
       "Photo simulation  is a technique that has been widely used in planning research and environmental psychology . It involves adapting photographs of sites so that they incorporate different changes to the physical environment under consideration. PS has been used to capture the impact of different physical interventions on people's preferences. For example, one study explored residents' preferences over a commercial strip development and used photo simulation to explore the impact of including a car park and natural elements, such as trees and flowers, on people's preferences over the development . Another study based in Switzerland explored how different forms of river restoration impacted upon the extent to which individuals perceived it satisfied their needs, among other outcomes . Photo simulation has also been used in a recent study to explore the impact of different architectural design features of care homes on older adults' attitudes toward these facilities ."

       "Another line of research, relating specifically to green infrastructure, has used photo simulation to explore the impact of the addition of green elements to physical environments on people's perceptions of sites, with a particular focus on perceptions of safety. In an early study, Kuo and colleagues  used PS to examine the impact of tree placement, tree density and levels of grass maintenance on Chicago residents' preferences and sense of safety of their local area, finding that both tree density and grass maintenance positively impacted the outcomes in question. A more recent study by Jiang and colleagues  used PS to investigate the impact of green interventions on people's perceptions of the safety of alleyways. They found that green interventions involving geometric vegetation increased perceptions of safety to a greater extent than did naturalistic vegetation. Finally, Nejati, Shepley, Rodiek, Lee, and Varni  used PS to demonstrate how adding natural elements to hospital staff break areas positively impacted upon staff members' perceptions of the restorative nature of these areas. This literature demonstrates that this technique can inform our understanding of individuals' perceptions of, as well as preferences over, sites. Moreover, PS can produce insights which inform the design and maintenance of both indoor and outdoor green infrastructure. In the current work, we use PS in conjunction with SWB measures to examine the potential benefits of urban green interventions.\n",

       "## 2. Methods\n",
       "\n",
       "We demonstrate our proposed approach in a study constructed using a specially developed online platform - www.urban-experiment.com - and implemented in person with attendees to the 20th Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism in Valparaiso in 2017.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2.1. Study design\n",
       "\n",
       "We designed the study to gather data on individuals' perceptions of a series of computerized visual simulations of street-level green interventions . We chose to use photo simulation, instead of other more technologically advanced methods such as 360-degree videos, as it represents a very low-cost technique to generate insights into the green interventions under consideration. In the planning process, it is typical for urban planners, architects and others to produce computerized images of their proposed interventions. In this study, we demonstrate how such images could be used in combination with images of the existing sites to gain low-cost insights into how the interventions might impact people's perceptions of those sites. While generating 360degree videos of existing sites is affordable, generating a 360-degree simulated video of high enough quality to render the green interventions believable is still relatively expensive and time-consuming. With a view to maximising the potential uptake of our approach among practitioners working on green infrastructure projects in both cities in the developing and developed world, we therefore opted to use photo simulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "We briefly expose participants to images urban sites either before or after the incorporation of a green intervention. They rated these images according to the happiness and stress they associated with them on a ten-point scale: from completely unhappy to completely happy and completely stressed to completely relaxed, respectively. Self-reports of happiness and stress represent affective measures of SWB that assess individuals' experiential rather than evaluative wellbeing. These two types of affect have dominated the SWB-green space literature to date . In the current work we adapt SWB measures that have been widely used to investigate people's affective wellbeing on the previous day  or in the moment using experience sampling . In addition to the two SWB measures, we also asked individuals to report their perceptions of the safety of the\n",
       "sites in question. As previously discussed, individuals' perceptions of safety commonly feature in the photo simulation literature.\n",
       "\n",
       "We used twelve pairs of images of urban sites before and after the incorporation of vegetation in the study. All images represent urban areas in France. The images represent four different types of green interventions: 1) green tram lines ; 2) green pedestrians streets ; 3) green avenues ; and 4) small green streets .\n",
       "\n",
       "We further categorised image types into three different scales of green interventions: small, medium and large. We modified the before and after images slightly to hold constant important features of the images  between the before and after pairs of images. As a result, we obtained twelve pairs of computerized images with each pair being equal in all its components but the incorporation of street vegetation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 2.2. Sampling method\n",
       "\n",
       "We installed a stand at the Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism from Friday to Sunday over the last week of October and the first week of November 2017. We chose this site as it gave us access to a convenience sample with which to demonstrate our approach of combining photo simulation with SWB measures to inform urban planning and design decisions. We specifically targeted this event as we expected to find enthusiastic volunteers among the attendees who would participate in our study without material incentive to do so. We were proven correct: of a total of 252 walking-by visitors who stopped at the urban experiment stand and we asked to participate in the study, 240 accepted. We approached potential participants and gave them a flyer about the urban experiment platform and asked them to participate in a 6-minute long study on urban perceptions. No monetary incentives or gifts were offered for participation. Once they had agreed to participate, the attendees completed an online registration process which included a questionnaire about their socio-demographic information , a brief about the study protocol and an informed consent form.\n",
       "\"After registering, we presented participants with a sequence of 12 images of urban sites on a 24 -inch screen in full-screen display mode. Participants saw each street image for a minimum of 6 s before rating the happiness and stress they associated with the site, as well as their perceptions of its safety . Participants took an average of $4: 12 \\mathrm{~min}$ to rate the series of 12 images we presented to them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "To ensure that the covariates were balanced between participants in the before and after groups, we applied a double randomization process using our computer programme: a random image-order assignment and a random before-or-after assignment. First, the programme randomly allocated the order of the twelve pairs of images for each participant. This allows us to control for potential spillover effects or fatigue affecting participants' responses from one picture to the next. Second, for each pair of images, the programme randomly assigned the participant to see either a before or after image. This double random assignment generated a unique order of appearance and combination of before/ after images for each respondent. Prior to conducting our analysis, we carried out balance tests at the image level to investigate whether there were differences across the before/after groups in the observed characteristics age, gender, student status, household size, nationality, subject of study, native language, educational level, employment status, image order, day of the test and hour of the test. Across the 156 tests we carried out only 5 were significant at the $5 \\%$ level indicating the the randomisation was successful ."

       "The main outcome of interest in this study is whether green interventions at the street-level result in improvements in participants' perceptions of the happiness, stress and safety associated with the sites in question. In the analysis, we use random intercepts models with fixed effects at the image level to explore this question. We include the random intercept to account for the fact that each respondent reports on their perceptions of 12 different images, and as a result, these reports are not independent of one another. We include the image fixed effects to control for each image's average SWB and safety ratings. The models take the following form:\n",
       "Perception $_{i j}=\\beta_{1}$ Treatment $_{i}+\\beta_{2}$ Image $_{j}+U_{j}+\\mathrm{E}_{i j}$\n",
       "where Perception $_{i j}$ is the perception rating given on a scale of 1 to 10 to the $i$ th photo by the $j$ th individual. Treatment is a dummy variable equal to one if the ith image contains a green street intervention  and 0 otherwise . The coefficient of central interest to us is $\\beta_{1}$, the Average Treatment Effect, which captures the effect of green interventions on people's reports of the happiness, stress and safety they associate with the sites. Image $_{i}$ is an image fixed effect for the ith image included to control for the fact that each image has different average SWB and safety ratings, reflected by $\\beta_{2} . U_{j}$ is the random intercept associated with the $j$ th individual, and $\\mathrm{E}_{i j}$ is the error term. We report significance levels at the $5 \\%$ and $1 \\%$ while considering a $5 \\%$ a reasonable threshold for the avoidance of Type 1 errors. We report the exact p -value in all cases where $\\mathrm{p}>.001$ .\n",

       "In this study, we examine the impact of green interventions on people's perceptions in a number of different ways. First, we run Eq.   at an aggregate level to estimate the overall impact of the streetlevel interventions on people's perceptions. Following that, we run a second analysis which involves running EQ1 on the subsamples of different types of green interventions to examine their impacts separately. Lastly, we explore whether the larger scale green interventions included in the study have a greater impact on the outcomes of interest, compared to smaller scale ones. As the interventions and sites vary across the images, we cannot make claims about the causal impact of the scale of green interventions but this analysis does provide some suggestive evidence as to whether scale matters. For this analysis, we run EQ1 on the three subsamples which divide the total sample according to the size of the green intervention. Small, medium and large\n",

As columns 1, 3 and 5 in Table A2  show, the incorporation of vegetation significantly increases people's perceptions of happiness  and safety , while decreasing perceived stress . As columns 2, 4, and 6 in Table A2 indicate these results are robust to the addition of 13 controls.

       "In a study carried out at the 20th Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism in Chile, we tested an innovative new approach to exploring the impact of green infrastructure interventions on individuals' perceptions of urban sites. The central contribution of this work is that it\n",
       "combines SWB measures with photo simulation to investigate the impact of small-scale street level greening of urban sites on the happiness and stress people associate with the images of the sites in question. In doing so, the work goes beyond the existing SWB-greenspace literature which has typically focused on the relationship between large-scale green spaces and the SWB of residents living in close proximity to them, as well as examining the impact of smaller scale green infrastructure on residents' levels satisfaction with their neighbourhood . It also builds on the photo simulation work which has considered how green infrastructure impacts on people's preferences over and perceptions of the safety of urban sites . Bringing SWB measures together with photo simulation allows us to produce a priori evidence of the positive impacts of green interventions on people's wellbeing perceptions of urban sites.\n",
       "\n",
       "Aggregating across a range of different types of green interventions, we find that individuals report higher levels of happiness and lower feelings of stress when exposed to simulated images which include street-level green interventions, compared to photos of the original sites. The percentage magnitude of the improvements in reports of both happiness and stress are similar. The results echo those of other work based on preference-based methods such as hedonic pricing strategies and willingness to pay studies, as well as research into neighbourhood satisfaction, which have produced evidence to suggest that small-scale green interventions are of value and can be effective strategies to create wellbeing benefits for people .\n",
       "\n",
       "In further analysis, we break the green interventions down by type and explore how the incorporation green tram lines, green pedestrian streets, green avenues, and small green streets impacts upon people's perceptions of urban sites. Differences in the impact of green interventions emerge from this analysis. While all types of green interventions have a positive impact according to the SWB metrics, the largest impact on perceived happiness levels is produced by the incorporation of vegetation in small streets, while the largest reduction of perceived stress is given by green tram lines. We also examine whether interventions of different scales have differing effects on people's SWB perceptions. In relation to happiness, and stress, the results suggest that scale may matter: the smallest scale interventions have the smallest impact across both these measures, but the differences across the scales are not statistically significant. In sum, the findings from the more finegrained analysis demonstrate that not all green interventions are equal when it comes to their impact on people's SWB perceptions.\n",

       "While SWB measures have not been traditionally used in the photo simulation literature that has looked to understand the impact of green interventions, existing work has considered the third outcome variable included in our analysis - people's perceptions of the safety of the sites in question. The incorporation of this outcome variable allows us to compare our SWB results to those found using this more common measure of individuals' perceptions. The comparison yields interesting results: although the SWB evidence indicates that all types of green interventions positively impact people's SWB perceptions of urban sites , the results relating to perceptions of safety are less consistent, with some interventions having a positive impact  and some no impact . Overall, and across all the different types of green interventions, bar green tram lines, the magnitude of the impact of green interventions on people's SWB reports is greater than the impact on their perceptions of safety. That the results differ significantly across the analyses of the SWB outcomes and the safety reports demonstrates that the SWB measures provide different insights to those offered by the existing literature which has mainly relied on perceptions of safety to examine the impact of green interventions on people's perceptions of urban sites.\n",
       "\n",
       "The work is not without limitations, which highlight future directions for research. The current study's findings are limited to a convenience sample of attendees at the 20th Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism. This sample of respondents likely have a greater interest in urban planning and architecture than the general public and it cannot be assumed that the equivalent impacts would be found if the same study were carried out with other populations. There is no a priori reason to believe that effects would disappear or change direction in other samples, but future work should explore this further. Additionally, although 99.6 per cent of the sample were Chilean, the photographs used in the photo simulation technique were from urban sites in France. As a result, the sites were likely unknown to the participants. This has the positive impact of controlling for prior knowledge of the site but differs from how this technique would likely be used in real urban planning processes. Future work should investigate whether simulations of green interventions have different effects on people's perceptions of SWB when they have prior knowledge of the area, for example, if it is in their local area compared to a place that they have never been to.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another important issue relating to the study is that there are two SWB outcomes variables involved in the main analysis. This issue is one that is more general to SWB research: there are outstanding questions in\n",

       "the literature as to whether SWB measures should be aggregated and if so what weighting should be given to each of the separate measures . Although the results suggest that the green interventions explored have significant positive impacts on happiness and negatives impacts on stress, it is possible that other urban interventions might increase perceptions of both happiness and stress. It is also possible that green interventions would have a negative impact on other aspects of SWB while benefiting people's happiness and stress perceptions. In order to explore these issues further, future work should look to include a wide range of theoretically-relevant SWB variables to explore the extent to which the impact of green interventions varies depending on the SWB measures under consideration.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relatedly, the approach does not produce monetary values associated with the various interventions which can feed into cost-benefit analysis. In contrast, stated preference methods can be used to produce monetary estimates of the value that local residents place on a green infrastructure project based on how much they say they would be willing to pay for it. In future, photo simulation could be incorporated into willingness to pay studies to estimate the benefits of green interventions using the before and after technique used in the current work. If such an approach was developed, it would be interesting to examine the associations between willingness to pay reports and SWB perceptions to see which perceptions are most predictive of the monetary values people place on the green interventions under consideration.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another limitation of this study relates to the fact that participants were only exposed to visual stimuli. Existing research indicates that combining street images with soundscapes can enhance the impact of nature simulations on people's wellbeing . In line with this, future studies should include street background noise to further our understanding of how green interventions may shape people's perceptions of the wellbeing they associate with urban sites.\n",
       "\n",
       "A final limitation of the study is that although this approach measures the impact of green interventions on people's perceptions, holding constant the contents of the images of the sites  outside of the intervention area, this technique cannot account for what is replaced by vegetation in the after images in the section of the image that includes the intervention. While is important to recognise this as a limitation, it is also worth highlighting that the approach has external validity in that real green interventions necessarily take up space that could otherwise be used differently, for example for parking or road space.\n",
       "\n",
       "The approach detailed in this work has the potential to feed into green infrastructure policy-making processes. It could be adopted by urban planners when looking to make green infrastructure investments to compare the impact of a range of different green investments across different sites on perceptions of the SWB associated with the site. Importantly, this approach should be incorporated into integrative sustainability policies which look to promote social as well as ecological sustainability in urban communities, taking into account the risks of gentrification that greening urban spaces can pose . One way in which this approach could contribute to these efforts would be to carry out this exercise with local residents in order to ensure that the perceptions of those who will be exposed to the intervention are taken into account. This is of particular importance given that existing research indicates that perceptions of the social environment interact with perceptions of the physical environment . For example, Chong et al.  found that the positive relationship between green space and\n",
       "\n",
       "SWB wellbeing is reversed in deprived neighbourhoods where residents perceive the outdoor environment to be unsafe. The current technique could ensure that local voices are included in the planning process and that the important interactions between individual characteristics, the social environment and the physical environment are accounted for.\n",
       "\n",
       "This technique could also be used by urban planners in ways which the current study does not directly speak to. For example, this approach could be used to test different green infrastructure project options for a single site. In this case, residents could be randomly presented with a range of different intervention options to establish which of them has the greatest positive impact on the residents' perceptions. This approach could also be used to explore the impact of other characteristics of green interventions which preference-based studies have identified as being important, such as whether the green space is protected or provides recreational amenities  and to investigate the impact of physical changes to urban sites other than those involving green elements. The online platform built for this study - www.urbanexperiment.com - could facilitate urban planners in carrying out these various form of analysis.\n",
       "\n",
       "## 5. Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "In this study, we present a new approach to examining the impact of green interventions on people's perceptions of urban sites. The technique involves randomly presenting participants with photos of urban sites before or after the incorporation of a green intervention and eliciting participants' perceptions of the SWB they associate with the site. The study involved collecting over 5000 ratings of images from 240 attendees of the 20th Architecture and Urbanism Biennale in Chile in 2017, which were used to explore the impact of street-level green interventions on people's perceptions of happiness and stress. With a view to linking the findings to existing photo simulation work, people's perceptions of the safety of the sites under consideration were also collected. The results show that street-level green interventions have a positive impact on the feelings of happiness and stress people associate with urban sites and that the impacts vary by the type of green intervention. The results relating to these two SWB measures are substantively different from those produced from using measures of people's perceptions of safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "SWB measures can be used in combination with photo simulation by urban planners looking to gain insights into the SWB impacts of various green infrastructure investment options across multiple sites. It can also be used to compares the different interventions options relating to a single site and the impact of other forms of infrastructure changes such as new commercial developments and public spaces. By placing people's SWB at the centre of infrastructure developments, the approach can feed into decisions about the greening of urban areas in order to maximise the benefits to people living in urban environments.\n",
