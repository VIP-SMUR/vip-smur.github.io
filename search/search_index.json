This semester, we utilized concepts in game theory, more specifically no-regret dynamics, in order to simulate the effects of the Atlanta Beltline on gentrification.

Key changes we have made to accommodate this implementation include: Incorporating the Four-Step Transportation Model, to determine mode of transportation for our agents, and an \"in Beltline\" attribute so our agents can differentiate between regions containing the Atlanta Beltline, and those outside of it. </p>"},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#the-four-step-model","title":"The Four-Step Model","text":"<p>Given that the agents move across various subregions of the Atlanta area in our simulation, one of the critical steps of the simulation is figuring out what subregion the agents go to. To do this in a way that accurately represents real-world distributions, we turned to the four-step model, a common trip generation algorithm: </p> <p></p> <p>The model has four components:</p> <ol> <li>Trip Generation: This part of the model estimates the number of trips originating from or destined for a specific area. It focuses on understanding how many trips are generated rather than specific travel patterns. This process usually involves some type of data pertaining to the area at hand, such as demographics, income, or land usage.</li> <li>Trip Distribution; This part of the model estimates the number of trips for routes that go from an area to another, as determined in the trip generation step. This process is typically done using the gravity model, which assumes that the number of trips are positively correlated with the attractiveness of an area and inversely correlated to distance.</li> <li>Mode Choice: This part of the model determines the mode of transporation used to make the trips. This is typically done by considering demographic data (such as the percentage of people with cars) in an area.</li> <li>Route Assignment: This part of the model determines the routes travelers take between origins and destinations. This is typically done by considering the route that takes the shorted possible time, and following that. </li> </ol> <p>Our approach closely follows these four components. We first generate trips by considering the amenity density of areas. We sum up all amenity densities, and divide each area's density by this sum to generate a probability. We then utilize a Poisson Distribution to generate the number of trips by multipling a base number of trips by the probability. We then consider trip distribution through a modified gravity model. The equation for our model is the following, given that we aim to go from area/region i to j:</p> <p></p> <p>We essentially multiply the total number of trips from area i to area j with the net amenity score for the destination j times transportation cost for that specific trip from area i to j, divided by the net amenity score for area j times the transportation cost from area i to j summed up over all destination j's. </p> <p>For our modal split, we assume that the car ownership rate is 0.7, and that the transit rate is 0.3. Each region's trips are split based on this. We then assign these routes based on the shortest possible distance.</p> <p>Through this process, we were able to have a methodical way of distributing the agents across Atlanta based on area factors such as amenity density.</p>"},{"location":"24fa-mponc/#census-based-approach","title":"Census-based approach","text":"<p>Our project utilizes data from the US census wherever possible. Notably, the graphical regions our agents inhabit correspond directly to US census tracts. Consequently, we can compare the economic and population data obtained from our simulation to actual census data for each census tract. Furthermore, since the US Census TIGER/Line Geodatabases contain publicly available shapefiles of all geographic regions it reports on, our simulation can likewise operate utilizing any other census-reported regions, including zip codes, housing districts, school districts, etc. </p> <p>Additionally, each 'agent' has a unique wealth attribute as one of the factors influencing decision-making. Instead of assigning these wealths arbitrarily, we create this distribution of wealth using census population and median income data, so that our agents are representative of actual Fulton and Dekalb county resident demographics. Namely, we use the following tables from the Census website: \"S1903 | Median Income In The Past 12 Months (In 2010 Inflation-adjusted Dollars) - ACS 5-Year Estimates Subject Tables\" and \"B01003 | Total Population - 2010: ACS 5-Year Estimates Detailed Tables\". By changing the hyperlinks in our code, our simulation can run with different distributions; for example, those from different years. * Note: For the median income and population tables, the hyperlinks in the code won't be 'activated', or functional, until a request is made directly on the Census website - navigate to those links and use the 'Download' button for the appropriate graphs, then run the code; no other action needed.

Pre-processing involves cleaning up the data and making it usable for the ML training workflow. For the spatial method that the team incorporated into the model, the OpenStreetMap Python library osmnx, and using the library, a map of Georgia Tech's campus was used as a basis. Overlayed on top of the map is system of equally spaced out points forming a grid. For each of the equidistant points, 12 distance vectors were obtained. Theses distances are from each point on the grid to the nearest centers of various variables; these various variables are buildings, libraries, parks, parking, footways, grass, fitness centers, woods, wetlands, trees on campus, and trees in Atlanta off Tech's campus. The tree data was not easily accessible through osmnx, so the team utilized Georgia Tech's Tree Viewer App for the tree location data and distances. In the Geo-LSTM-Kriging model that our team followed, Kriging is a statistical method for spacial interpolation, predicting unknown values at locations that don\u2019t have measured values by using spatial correlations. These spatial correlations, the 12 distance vectors for each x,y point, are based off of relationships between variables. Dr. Brian Stone's weather data obtained from the several weather stations he set up a year ago on Tech's campus was used as an input for pre-processing as well, and it mainly provided information on temperatures, dew point, and relative humidity. This is the data that our group tried to find out and this data will be used as a means for comparison and training the machine learning model. The weather data from Dr. Stone's weather stations were quite messy and required cleaning. The coordinates for each of the weather stations were obtained and separated into folders. Within each of the weather station files, the averages of the data columns, namely the temperatures, dew point, and relative humidities columns, were obtained. This normalization of data to a value of zero to one ensures that during training, there will not be any errors that come up when predicting new values. Each of the normalized values were then appended into a dictionary for machine learning training. Originally, our team tried to train the weather station files in one single large data set, however it was too much for a computer to handle, so splitting it up to dictionaries ensure that it was able to run very smoothly. The outputs of the pre-processing workflow are the CSV file for the grid distances and a CSV for the normalized weather station values. </p> <p> </p> <p>Using PyTorch, the team set the main target for the prediction as the temperature and main features as relative humidity and dew point. A sequence for the LSTM was created and set as default the 10 time steps. The team did not change the parameter values too much, as the team followed the documentation's recommendations. The hidden size was changed to about 8 layers and 200 epochs, which are how many iterations one wants the program to run through the training and ensures that the program is decently trained and not too overfitted. After training each of the weather station files independently, they are all appended into one single data frame to obtain the average prediction results for each of the stations.</p> <p> </p> <p>The distance vectors obtained from each of the approximately 1300 different grid points mentioned earlier were used for the actual Geo-Kriging part of the project. The model is based off the random forest regression because random forest typically works well with a lot of different types of parameters, especially if the data turns out to be non linear.</p> <p> </p> <p>The team finally fit the model with these parameters to obtain a temperature graph displaying the heat distribution of Georgia Tech's campus. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"24fa-microclimate-lstm-kriging/#future-work","title":"Future Work","text":"<p>The team would like to run further validation studies on the model to ensure its functionality in different climates and with consistent data.
